Rama Rao (NTR). Participating in a discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor’s address to the Legislature, Mr. Ramakrishna said NTR’s vision and leadership, which propelled the TDP to power in nine months of its coming into existence in the 1980s, was unforgettable, and this was the time to have Bharat Ratna conferred on him though it was inordinately delayed. He expressed the opinion that Speaker Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu, Deputy Speaker K. Raghu Ramakrishna Raju, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan should meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and make a fervent appeal for honouring NTR. While showering praise on NTR, he also highlighted the accomplishments of Nara Bhuvaneswari and Nara Brahmani in the corporate sector, and of Nara Devansh in chess.

Despite some isolated incidents, the strike remained largely peaceful.  Supporters of the strike reportedly forced the closure of several private banks and financial institutions in Kattappana.  The impact of the strike was most pronounced in tea plantation sector, which witnessed an almost complete shutdown. Cardamom plantations, which depend heavily on labourers from Tamil Nadu, were also affected as vehicles transporting workers failed to reach the district. However, migrant workers in some plantations reported for work on Thursday. Major towns, including Thodupuzha, Adimaly, Kattappana, Kumily, Munnar and Cheruthoni, wore a deserted look. Only a few vehicles carrying tourists and essential travellers were seen on the road in popular destinations such as Munnar, Wagamon and Thekkady.

Kameswara Rao addressing employees and workers on Thursday in Vizianagaram during the nationwide strike. \n                                          | Photo Credit: BY ARRANGEMENT\n                                       The Communist Party of India (CPI) took out a rally in Vizianagaram on Thursday as part of the nationwide strike organised to oppose the Labour Codes which are set to come into force from April 1, 2026.  Speaking to the media CPI State executive member P. Kameswara Rao along with senior party leader Bugata Ashok said that the four new Labour Codes are detrimental to the interests of crores of labourers in the country, as all rules and regulations in the codes favour the corporate and service sectors. The earlier 20 Labour Acts protected the interests of labourers, and simultaneously gave managements an opportunity to protect the productivity of the companies. The policies are also harmful to the farm sector, as a result farmers extended their support to the strike.   Several Left parties took out rallies and protests in Pydibhimavaram industrial zone of Srikakulam district. They raised slogans against the government and insisted on the withdrawal of the four Labour Codes. The strike had a partial impact on public life, as APSRTC could not operate buses on all routes.

Damodar Raja Narasimha on Thursday. During a review meeting, the Minister directed officials to complete all civil works, equipment installation and staff training by the second week of March. Officials informed the Minister that infrastructure development at the 1,000-bed Sanathnagar TIMS has reached the final stage. As many as 16 operation theatres have been readied for surgeries. Installation of advanced diagnostic equipment including CT scan, MRI and digital X-ray machines has been completed, while work on other diagnostic facilities is under way. The hospital js being developed as a Centre of Excellence for Cardiac Care and a Centre of Excellence for Organ Transplantation. The minister enquired about the establishment of cath labs for heart procedures and dedicated operation theatres for organ transplant surgeries. He said the hospital would significantly reduce patient pressure on Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), Osmania General Hospital (OGH) and Gandhi Hospital. He suggested that patients who have been waiting for months for surgeries at these hospitals be referred to TIMS Sanathnagar to ensure timely treatment. Apart from medical infrastructure, the Minister reviewed recruitment of professors, doctors, nursing and paramedical staff required to run the hospital. Given that it is a new facility, he proposed utilising the services of senior doctors under the Director of Medical Education (DME) and NIMS to strengthen the initial phase of operations.

The incident occurred on Saturday (February 7, 2026). The youth was later rescued by the district police, which said investigations are on in the case. Mr. Kumar was preparing for police recruitment and, while returning from a library late on February 7, he claimed he was offered a drink laced with a sedative by a group of people and later beaten and forced to marry a girl at a temple in Morwa village, about four kilometres away. The bride is said to be a resident of Chakraja Ali village. A case has been lodged in this regard at Shahpur Patori police station of the district. Meanwhile, a video of the marriage went viral on social media in which the groom is seen appearing intoxicated and some women are singing local marriage songs, while the bride is sitting near the groom in traditional wedding attire covering her face with a long ghunghat (veil). The bride is said to be the daughter of Shankar Rai of Chakraja Ali village. The incident is said to have occurred on February 7 but, after the video went viral, the local police rescued the groom on Tuesday (February 10, 2026). In another video, Mr. Kumar was purportedly shown locked inside a room, pleading for help after being held captive for 24 hours. “During my captivity in the room I somehow manage to record a video which, later, went viral on social media,” Mr. Kumar said in his complaint to the police. “Nitish Kumar’s family members were searching for him after he went missing on February 7. After seeing the video, they informed the police about it and lodged the complaint at Patori police station and the police subsequently, rescued Mr. Kumar and handed him over to his family,” Deputy Superintendent of Police, Shahpur Patori, B.K. Medhavi, said.  However, the station incharge of the police station, Anil Kumar, said, “No arrest has been made yet in the case as the family members of the bride has claimed it was an arranged marriage and the villagers, earlier, had attempted to mediate between the two families but after recording the victim’s statement further action will be taken.” Earlier, on November 29, 2023, a government school teacher, Gautam Kumar, was allegedly abducted from Maheya-Malpur village in Vaishali district of the State and forcibly married at gunpoint. A case was lodged at the local Patepur police station of the district. Even after being rescued, Mr. Gautam Kumar and his family members were afraid of becoming victims of violence from the bride’s family. In Bihar, the illegal forceful marriage practice known as pakadwa vivah has existed for long, in which eligible bachelors are abducted, sometimes at gunpoint, and forced into wedlock with a girl, often from a poor family that cannot afford the payment of dowry. Though such incidents are rarer now, cases continue to surface occasionally from across the State. A significant number of such cases go unreported for fear of violence and societal pressure. Districts such as Begusarai, Lakhisarai, Munger, Khagaria and Nawada are considered hotbeds of pakadwa vivah.

POORNACHANDRA KUMAR\n                                       Amid a looming national farm labour shortage, the ‘Kisan Mela’ organised in Tirupati highlighted the urgent need for mechanisation. The event was conducted by the Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) for the benefit of farmers from Tirupati, Chittoor, Nellore, Kadapa, and Annamayya districts.  Apart from encouraging mechanisation, the Kisan Mela also focussed on natural farming, crop diversification, value addition to the end product and post-harvest management techniques to make farming remunerative. Tirupati District Collector S. Venkateswar, who formally inaugurated the event, advised the farmers to think beyond the routine agricultural practices and adopt contemporary methods. “Farmers have become attuned to the traditional sowing and harvesting stereotypes, which needs to change. You have to join hands to form Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), adopt technology and mechanisation, take up value addition and marketing and importantly, follow the advice of agricultural scientists and officials, to earn more produce,” he said. ANGRAU Vice-Chancellor Saradha Jayalakshmi, former Vice-Chancellor V. Damodara Naidu, Srikalahasti Agricultural Market Committee Chairman R. Chenchaiah Naidu, officials of the Agriculture and Horticulture Department and progressive farmers took part.

Anthropic Software Private Limited (ASPL), with its office in Bauxite Road in Belagavi, had registered the name of the company with the appropriate authority in India in 2017. It has claimed that it is suffering daily losses as the US-based company is driving away all its online traffic. In a case filed with the district court, Ayyaz Mulla, one of the founder-directors of ASPL, has alleged that its “online visibility has been displaced, with search and AI-based platforms prioritising” the US company’s name. They have accused the US Anthropic of passing off, misrepresentation, and erosion of the Indian company’s brand identity. Mr. Mulla’s petition has requested the court to restrain the company from using the name Anthropic, not to operate in India with that name, and pay damages of around ₹1 crore. The Supreme Court on February 12, 2026, refused to intervene in a Karnataka High Court decision refusing to grant anticipatory bail to BJP MLA B.A. Basavaraj (Byrathi Basavaraj) in the July 2025 murder of Shivaprakash alias Bikla Shiva, a realtor-cum-rowdy-sheeter, while highlighting the close nexus between land-grabbers and politicians. “Land-grabbers have political protection. It is true the public perception is that land-grabbers have one or the other protection,” Chief Justice of India Surya Kant remarked. The Bench, also comprising Justice Joymalya Bagchi, gave the MLA liberty to apply for regular bail after surrendering in the case. Thousands of workers and trade union activists gathered at Town Hall in Bengaluru in response to the general strike called by the joint committee of trade unions against the four labour codes on February 12. Trade unionists from CITU, INTUC, AITUC, HMS, AIUTUC, AICCTU, TUCC and HMKP took part in the protest. The workers who demanded repeal of the labour codes and reinstatement of MGNREGA, were detained, arrested and removed from the spot by the police. The police removed close to 10 busloads of workers from the Town Hall area. Many of the arrested protesters were taken to the CAR police grounds in Adugodi, where they continued the protest.  The Siddapura police have filed a chargesheet against nine accused in connection with the sensational ₹7.11 crore dacoity reported under Siddapura Police Station limits in Bengaluru on November 19. After an extensive probe lasting three months, the Investigating Officer has submitted the final report to the 56th ACMM CCH Court. According to police, the charge sheet is backed by 129 documentary and material exhibits. The evidence includes eyewitness testimonies, technical data, and forensic findings, such as fingerprint analysis, that allegedly establish the involvement of the accused.

Raising the issue in the House on Thursday, Tirupati MLA Arani Srinivasulu urged the government to focus on the growing drinking water needs of the pilgrim city. “Increasing number of devotees and expansion of commercial activities in Tirupati have significantly raised water demand, necessitating urgent and long-term measures,” he said. Responding to the concern, Mr. Ramanaidu said the government had already initiated steps to augment drinking water supply through the Handri–Neeva Sujala Sravanti (HNSS) and Galeru–Nagari Sujala Sravanti (GNSS) projects. At present, the drinking water needs of Tirupati and Tirumala were being met through three primary sources — K.P. Canal (also known as the SSG Canal), Kalyani Dam, and a series of dams located in Tirumala, including Gogarbham, Akashaganga, Papavinasanam, Kumaradhara and Pasupudhara. To meet the growing demand and ensure long-term sustainability, the government proposed to supply drinking water through the GNSS Phase-II and the HNSS project. “Under the GNSS Phase-II, water will be allocated specifically for Tirupati and Tirumala,” the Minister said. Puttaparthi MLA Palle Sindhura Reddy sought clarification on the proposal to establish an IIIT in Puttaparthi. Responding to the query, HRD Minister Nara Lokesh said there was no such proposal under the government’s consideration. “The State has four IIIT campuses and requires ₹600 crore to complete infrastructure works in the existing institutions. The focus is to ensure students are accommodated on the campus premises,” Mr. Lokesh said, adding that the proposal would be brought to the notice of the Chief Minister. When Polavaram MLA Balaraju raised the issue of transfer of employees in the tribal areas, Minister G. Sandhya Rani said steps were being taken to ensure posting of tribal employees within the tribal regions. “Court-related issues pending since the previous regime have caused complications,” she said. Vizianagaram MLA Pusapati Aditi Vijayalakshmi sought clarification on the status of pre-matric and post-matric scholarships, and revision of mess charges provided to the students. Responding to the query, BC Welfare Minister Savita said directions had been given to review and enhance the mess charges. She said the government was committed to ensuring students quality food with adequate nutritional value in hostels and educational institutions. “Welfare of the students remains a priority for the government and measures will be taken to improve facilities and financial support systems. The proposed revision is aimed at addressing rising costs and ensuring better living conditions for students, particularly those from economically weaker sections,” the Minister said.

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which maintains the protected monument, has sought the intervention of the district administration to clear the shops. The Brihadisvara Temple is listed as one of the three Great Living Chola Temples by UNESCO.  Several platform shops, selling a variety of items including food items and toys, have cropped up in front of the temple on the Gangaikondacholapuram-Mettupalayam Road, obstructing vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  “Previously the vendors used to set shop only during festivals. But as the temple is now attracting a continuous stream of tourists and devotees, after the recent visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the shops have become a permanent feature,” said R. Komagan, founder chairman, Gangaikondacholapuram Development Council Trust.  Pointing to the encroachments within the protected area of the monument, Mr. Komagan said the shops were obstructing movement of visitors to the temples and their vehicles going to and from the area used as parking lot now in front of the temple. Besides, it was the access road to Mettupalayam and other hamlets and residents of these places were facing hardship in their commute and transporting agricultural produce due to the encroachments.  Emphasising the need to clear the shops immediately, Mr. Komagan expressed apprehension that it would become impossible to remove them if they became permanent structures later on. The emergence of the shops also caused indiscriminate littering of the surroundings and pollution of the temple ‘thirukulam’ situated close by, he added.  When contacted, an official of the ASI said that they had taken up the matter with the district administration already and hoped expeditious action will be taken.  In letters addressed to the District Collector, officials of the ASI, Tiruchi Circle, have pointed out that the temple was a protected monument and shops and the parking areas fell under the prohibited area of the monument. Most of them were close to the fence around the temple and were obstructing movement of vehicles.  The shops had been set up without any permission and they obstructed the view of the monument, besides causing congestion in the area, the ASI had said while requesting the Collector to remove the shops.  Besides, a significant problem of litter had arisen as some of the vendors sell eatables in disposable plastic bags, containers and bottles, which are often carelessly discarded affecting the cleanliness around the temple, it was pointed out.

City Police Commissioner Seema Latkar received the complaint from the Congress delegation. \n                                          | Photo Credit: M. A. Sriram\n                                       The Congress party has lodged a police complaint against BJP for portraying Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s son and MLC Yathindra in a derogatory manner. After submitting a complaint to City Police Commissioner Seema Latkar in the presence of Mysuru District Congress Committee President Vijaykumar and Mysuru City Congress Committee President R. Murthy, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) spokesperson M. Lakshmana sought registration of an FIR in the matter and action against the persons responsible for the same. Mr. Lakshmana also accused former MP Pratap Simha of making similar derogatory remarks against Mr. Yathindra while speaking to reporters in Mysuru on February 10. Mr. Lakshmana alleged that the social media account of BJP Karnataka as well as Mr. Pratap Simha had described Mr. Yathindra in a derogatory manner. “Such statements not only damage the dignity of Yathindra Siddaramaiah, but also appear to be a deliberate attempt to provoke Congress workers and create unrest”, he said. He also alleged that BJP leaders R. Ashoka, Chalavadi Narayanaswamy, C. T. Ravi, V. Somanna and B. Y. Vijayendra have repeatedly been making false allegations against the Chief Minister as well. “These defamatory statements and false accusations clearly indicate an intention on the part of the above BJP leaders to create unrest in society,” he said in a statement here. He said the Congress party workers have refrained from taking the law in their own hands and submitting a complaint seeking appropriate action as per law and within the constitutional framework.

Chairing a meeting of district-level officers of various departments in Dharwad on Thursday, the Deputy Commissioner said that Dharwad district had earned national recognition because of its contribution to the field of literature, music and education, and it was everyone’s responsibility to contribute towards the district’s overall development. Ms. Snehal said that the State government had provided ample technological support to ensure effective implementation of welfare schemes and the officers must be cautious to ensure there was no unnecessary delay, apathy or dereliction of duty while delivering government services. “Any such complaint will be considered seriously and appropriate action will be taken,” she warned. Understanding one’s responsibility and accountability was essential to discharge one’s duties as per law, she said adding that no public should be put to inconvenience because of personal reasons or shortcomings. She also underscored the need for providing solutions at the local level and if only the issue required intervention of senior officials, it should be brought to their notice. The Deputy Commissioner told the officials that they should contact her directly in cases of matters that required urgent action. She also said that the general public could meet her between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.  Published - February 12, 2026 06:41 pm IST \n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

GOTEC is aimed at enhancing the English language skills of students in rural areas, developing their leadership skills, and career development. Under the initiative, 50 Class VII and VIII students selected from each of the 78 government schools where the programme is implemented are given GOTEC training. Trained teachers take 50 sessions according to a module for each student. Besides this, resource teachers deployed by the deputy director of education visit the schools to give required directions for the training, and take classes. Ahead of the grand finale, a semi-final was held in which it was mandatory for all the 78 participating schools to take part. The institutions could take part either in three individual events or two group events. The 86 students who emerged successful in the semi-final took part in the grand finale. The competition winners were presented with prizes at the event. A special prize was given to the school that excelled, and course certificates were presented to all students who completed the training. Seven schools that stood out for their novel activities were presented with a ‘president’s trophy.’ Students who received GOTEC training this academic year will be provided with more classes the next academic year, while new students will be given training as per the module, a statement here said. These GOTEC ambassadors will disseminate English language skills to other students in the schools, thereby opening the doors to various opportunities to them globally, the statement said. District panchayat health-education standing committee chairperson K.R. Shaiju inaugurated the valedictory event. Kalyani Vallath, educator, was the chief guest.

The strike was largely peaceful, but normal life was severely affected with all commercial establishments, including shops and restaurants, remaining closed. Public transport ground to a halt as private buses, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) services and taxis stayed off the road. There were isolated incidents of protesters blocking vehicles and forcing commercial establishments to shut down. In Changanassery, demonstrators compelled a restaurant in Paippad to close, while in Kuravilangad, a KSRTC bus attempting to operate a service was stopped. Despite the shutdown, a large number of private vehicles and two-wheelers continued to move, providing some relief to motorists. Petrol stations in several localities also remained open. In Pathanamthitta, exemptions were granted to Sabarimala devotees and those travelling to the Maramon Convention. The procession connected with the Cherukolpuzha Hindu religious meet proceeded without disruptions, though there were minor incidents in some areas. Government offices, banks and other official establishments were nearly paralysed. Offices in the District Collectorates reported low staff attendance. Trade union leaders organised protest marches across various centres in solidarity with the strike.

Anthropic Software Private Limited (ASPL), with its office in Bauxite Road in Belagavi, had registered the name of the company with the appropriate authority in India in 2017. It has claimed that it is suffering daily losses as the US-based company is driving all its online traffic.  In a case filed with the district court, Ayyaz Mulla, one of the founder directors of ASPL, has alleged that its “online visibility has been displaced, with search and AI-based platforms prioritising” the American company’s name. They have accused the American Anthropic of passing off, misrepresentation, and erosion of the Indian company’s brand identity in India.  “Our company was registered in India in 2017, even before Anthropic PBC was registered in the US. In fact, they have registered in India recently and set up an office in Bengaluru a few months ago,” Mr Mulla told The Hindu. Though the court refused to issue an injunction against the US namesake, it has issued notices. The next hearing is on February 21 in Belagavi court, according to Mr. Mulla.  He claimed that till around 6-8 months, most of the online queries for Anthropic were directed to their site. “But now, most of the online searches are leading to the US company and we are losing business every day,” he said.  Mr. Mulla’s petition has requested the court to restrain the company from using the name Anthropic, not to operate in India with that name, and pay damages of around ₹1 crore. Mr. Mulla, describes his venture as a IT company working in the fields of Research and Development and Artificial Intelligence. An engineering graduate, Mr. Mulla studied in BVV college in Bagalkot before shifting to work for IT companies in the US. After nearly two decades of experience, he came back to set up a R&D based IT company. “We have several patented products in the fields of education, Wifi monetisation, and online safety,” he added. “We four friends have pooled all our savings to start this company. We have not taken salaries in these nine years as we were reinvesting. We cannot bear such losses. We are also sad that the US company was able to register itself in India, despite the existence of an older company with the same name,” he said.

Ayyanna Patrudu. File \n                                          | Photo Credit: K.V.S. GIRI \n                                       Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly Speaker Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu on Thursday expressed deep anguish over the incidents witnessed during the Governor’s address to the State Legislature on the inaugural day of the Budget Session on Wednesday. Referring to the disruptions in the House, the Speaker said the conduct of “certain members” hurt the dignity of the Legislature. Sloganeering and tearing of papers during the Governor’s speech were highly unfortunate and distressing, he observed. “When the Governor was addressing the House yesterday, the scenes that unfolded deeply pained me. Such actions diminish the prestige of this august institution,” the Speaker said. “To get elected as one among the 175 legislators is a rare honour. It is the collective responsibility of all the members to uphold the dignity and decorum of the House. The members are requested to introspect,” he said. When children were present in the galleries to observe the proceedings, the public representatives did not even consider what impression they would leave on them, the Speaker said, adding that “this incident has deeply disturbed me.” Stating that students from over 200 educational institutions across the State had shown interest in visiting the Legislative Assembly to observe its proceedings, he said. “We allowed children to witness the proceedings with an intention of fostering respect for democratic institutions. What will they learn if they see unruly behaviour? If a sense of disrespect towards legislatures develops in the young minds, it will be difficult to reverse,” the Speaker said, adding, “The members may not succeed in enriching the prestige of the House, but they have no right to bring it down.”  Published - February 12, 2026 06:24 pm IST \n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The authority has advised the public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses. At present, the variation in maximum daytime temperatures across several parts of the State is limited to around 2°C. However, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) extended forecast, a gradual rise of 2°C to 3°C in maximum temperatures is expected over the next two weeks. The monthly outlook for February also indicates above-normal maximum temperatures in Kerala during the month.  Minimum temperatures are likely to increase gradually by 2°C to 3°C across most parts of the country, including peninsular India, during the remaining half of the month. Kannur has recorded the highest temperature in the State for the past two days, with the mercury touching 37.2°C. As daytime temperatures continue to climb, an increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels, reflected in the UV index, is also expected in the coming days. UV radiation, a form of energy emitted by the sun, can cause various health problems, including damage to the skin and eyes. According to a KSDMA advisory, prolonged exposure to UV rays can lead to sunburn, skin disorders, eye ailments and other health issues. Urging the public to exercise caution, the advisory noted that UV radiation levels are typically highest between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., and advised people to avoid prolonged direct exposure to sunlight during these hours. Those who work outdoors, including fishermen engaged in marine and inland fishing, water transport workers, bikers, tourists, and individuals with skin conditions, eye diseases, cancer, or low immunity, have been advised to remain particularly cautious.  In view of the rising heat, the KSDMA has also urged people to avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. and to drink plenty of water even if they do not feel thirsty. The advisory recommends avoiding dehydrating beverages such as alcohol, coffee, tea and carbonated soft drinks during the daytime. Wearing loose, light-coloured cotton clothing is advised, along with using footwear when stepping outdoors and carrying an umbrella or wearing a hat. Consuming plenty of fruits and vegetables, as well as oral rehydration solutions (ORS) and drinks such as ‘sambaram’, can help minimise the impact of the rising heat, the advisory added.

The initiative will assist 8 lakh students across Science, Commerce, and Humanities streams as they appear for competitive examinations, including KEAM, NEET, CUET, CA Foundation, and PSCs.   This marks the first time a State government is providing free entrance coaching for students of all streams by leveraging AI technology, KITE chief executive officer K. Anvar Sadath said in a statement on Thursday (February 12, 2026).  Since practical experience is vital for competitive exams, extensive mock tests have been arranged on the portal for self-practice. Mr. Sadath said the AI system implemented this year through KITE’s ‘Samagra AI Learning Room’ generates personalised study plans based on each student’s learning pace and exam performance.   The system analyses the progress of every test taken by a student and provides question sets across three levels – Beginner, Intermediate, and Excellent – tailored to the student’s specific aptitude. In addition to the AI-driven features, over 20,000 questions verified by expert teachers are available on the portal. Training for subjects including Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Botany, Zoology, Economics, Accountancy, Business Studies, and Political Science is available on the portal starting Thursday.   The second phase, beginning on February 25, will include training in English, reasoning, and general awareness. Schools have been directed to disseminate information about the training at all levels, including school PTAs, to ensure that all students can participate in it.   Students of Classes XI and XII can access these services via the portal www.entrance.kite.kerala.gov.in using login details provided by their schools. The student’s higher secondary or vocational higher secondary application number serves as the User ID, which is already available on the portal.   Principals or nodal teachers will generate passwords accordingly. Detailed user guides and video tutorials are also provided on the portal. In addition to the classes aired on the KITE Victers channel, students can watch the sessions anytime through the entrance portal and the KITE Victers YouTube channel (youtube.com/itsvicters).   School Principals have been instructed to provide necessary facilities within schools for students who lack personal digital devices or internet access. For further technical assistance, the respective district offices of KITE may be contacted.
