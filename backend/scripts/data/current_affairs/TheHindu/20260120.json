The police issued a fresh advisory cautioning citizens against fake traffic challan scams in the city. Officials said several residents continue to fall prey to such fraud despite repeated warnings.  Hyderabad Police Commissioner V.C. Sajjanar said cybercriminals are sending phishing links through SMS, falsely claiming that traffic challans have been issued. These messages redirect users to fake websites that closely resemble official government portals. Unsuspecting victims who enter their details on these sites risk having their bank accounts emptied within minutes.  Khairatabad Zone Deputy Commissioner of Police K. Shilpavalli revealed took to X and shared that she herself had recently received two fake traffic challan messages on her mobile phone. The fraudulent SMS messages, received within a span of three days, claimed that a challan had been issued and carried suspicious links posing as official portals.  It is concerning that despite repeated alerts, many citizens in Hyderabad are falling prey to Fake Traffic Challan scams. We are observing a sharp rise in these cases recently.Fraudsters are sending phishing links via SMS. Once clicked, these redirect to fake websites that look… pic.twitter.com/bld1xXo6IM Calling the messages fraudulent, the DCP said she did not click on the links and instead reported them on the Central government’s Sanchar Saathi portal.   Sajjanar cautioned citizens against clicking on unknown links and reminded them that genuine government traffic challan websites end with “.gov.in”. The official stressed that traffic challans should be verified only through the official e-Challan website and that payments should never be made through links received via SMS. The officer urged people to promptly report such suspicious messages to prevent financial fraud.

Sithamparanathan, recently took place in Mysuru. On behalf of IIET, representatives introduced members of TAG and emphasised the importance of their theatre work in Sri Lanka, especially for those who lost loved ones during the civil war, highlighting the value of mutual learning and cultural exchange. Addressing the gathering, Dr. K. Sithamparanathan explained that TAG uses theatre as a means to create safe spaces where people can come together and express themselves without fear. He said performing in India offered the freedom to express emotions and rediscover one’s creative potential. The TAG team comprises artistes ranging from higher secondary students to middle-aged performers, all of whom were displaced due to the war. Coming from different regions, they have formed a strong community through theatre. Every January, the group travels to Thailand and Karnataka to engage in performances that use theatre.  Dr. Sithamparanathan expressed TAG’s desire to exchange ideas and values with local artistes from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, according to a press release. Senior theatre director Shashidhara Adapa and Neelagara Mysuru Gururaj were also present at the programme held on Sunday. As part of the cultural exchange, IIET invited folk singer Dr. Gururaj, who captivated the audience with performances and storytelling through Manteswamy and Male Mahadeshwara songs. He spoke about how his father played a key role in carrying forward this rich folk tradition and emphasised that its core intention is to promote harmony across castes and religions. This was followed by a puppet show presented by Bhoopathi and his team, performed for the TAG members. The TAG team also presented theatre work focused on supporting oppressed communities in rural villages. “By encouraging people to narrate their personal experiences through theatre, TAG helps individuals confront and heal from the trauma they endured during the 2009 civil war. This creative process enables participants to open up emotionally and work towards building more peaceful and dignified lives,” the press release said.

File photo: Special Arrangement.\n                                       The Supreme Court on Tuesday (January 20, 2026) decided to examine petitions filed by the States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu asking if the Directorate of Enforcement (ED), a Central agency, is a “juristic person” who can approach High Courts for enforcement of its “rights”. A ‘juristic’ person is a legal fiction by which a non-human, like an incorporated company, is recognised to have rights, duties, sue or be sued like a ‘natural’ person. A Bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma took serious note of the question of law raised by the States, which have been riddled by ED raids and legal actions in recent times. The Bench issued notice to the ED, posting the case for hearing after four weeks. Kerala said the ED cannot consider itself a “person” but is only a statutory creation. The train of events began with the ED filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Kerala High Court. The agency had challenged a notification issued by the State in May 2021 setting up a Commission of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate an audio clip and a letter from two accused persons in the gold smuggling case. The duo had alleged that ED officials were coaxing them to implicate persons holding high offices in the State. The State government had tasked the Inquiry Commission to probe if there was a conspiracy afoot against the State’s political leaders and, if so, to unearth the identity of those behind the plot. On hearing of Kerala’s cause, Tamil Nadu has joined ranks with its neighbour in the Supreme Court. Tamil Nadu accused ED of indulging in a “gross and blatant abuse of the process of law by invoking the writ jurisdiction of the Madras High Court seeking mandamus for registration of a case relating to the alleged illegal mining”. It argued that the ED’s writs in the High Court were “misconceived and unmaintainable”. Both States want the Supreme Court to decide the question of law authoritatively. “A statutory body can exercise only the power conferred by the relevant statute and all statutory bodies need not be body corporate with power to sue. Only a body corporate, with power to sue specifically conferred by the statute, can claim legal status or juristic person, which the Enforcement Directorate admittedly does not have. The Deputy Director of Enforcement is only an officer under the Directorate of Enforcement and is not a juristic person,” Kerala argued in the top court. The State submitted that the Deputy Director of ED was only an officer and not a juristic person. “Hence, he also could not have filed a writ petition. Therefore, the finding of the High Court that the Deputy Director of Enforcement has locus standi to institute the writ petition is erroneous... Neither the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act nor that of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act constituted any character or right in law to entitle the ED to be recognised as one clothed with legal personality to be treated as a juristic person eligible in law to sue,” the Kerala petition contended. Both the States referred to the Supreme Court judgment in the case law, Chief Conservator of Forests, Government of Andhra Pradesh versus Collector, which held that whether a legal entity — a natural person or an artificial person — could sue or be sued in his/its own name in a court of law or a tribunal was not merely a procedural formality and was essentially a matter of substance and considerable significance.

Khandre\n                                       Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre was unanimously elected president of the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha on Tuesday. He was elected president following the demise of senior Congress leader and Mahasabha president Shamanur Shivashankarappa recently.  Mr. Khandre’s elevation to the post of the president was announced by former IPS and Mahasabha Karnataka unit president Shankar Bidari. Mr. Khandre served as the general secretary of Mahasabha for 13 years and had held the in-charge post of senior vice-president since the last one year. Thanking the committee for elevating him unanimously, Mr. Khandre said, “Veerashaiavas and Lingayats are not different. It is important to unite all sub-castes. Approximately 40% to 50% of the people in the community are backward, and about 30% are the most backward. I will strive to provide justice to all”. The executive committee of the Mahasabha, which met on Tuesday, unanimously chose the Forest Minister to head the Mahasabha.  Mr. Khandre’s father, Bheemanna Khandre, who passed away recently, was associated with the Mahasabha for several decades.

Tackling lifestyle diseases, emergency and trauma care and elderly care will be the main public health priorities for the State in the next few years, Mr. Arlekar said in his policy address, which marked the commencement of the 16th session of the 15th Kerala Assembly. The government will provide enhanced care and support for those with lifestyle diseases and implement trauma and emergency care through the Kerala Health Systems Improvement Project, which is being implemented in the State with World Bank funds. The project will focus on taking up interventions to make climate-resilient health infrastructure and strengthen antimicrobial resistance activities. The functioning of Kerala-Centre for Disease Control (K-CDC) is expected to commence during the current financial year, Mr. Arlekar said in his policy address. Disease control activities will be implemented at the grassroots through Janakeeya Arogya Kendrams, guided by the Arogya Jagratha calendar. Kerala has already launched a wellness campaign this New Year, with the aim of promoting behaviour and lifestyle changes among people. Mental health services will be expanded through the Sampoorna Manasika Arogyam Programme, the coverage of which will be extended to more grama panchayats, with treatment anchored at the primary care level. The State is strengthening diagnostic capacity through upgraded laboratories and quality accreditation of laboratories. As part of the Navakeralam Karma Padhathi, outpatient divisions in hospitals have been transformed, upgradation of primary health centres as family health centres  and expansion of LaQshya labour room standards are under way. Infrastructure development in the State’s health sector is being supported through KIIFB and NABARD and steps are being taken to  improve human resource in the health sector. Digital governance has been consolidated through the rollout of e-office systems across health institutions, enhancing efficiency, transparency and quality of service delivery. Mr. Arlekar pointed out that the government has worked towards expanding access to critical care by ensuring dialysis facilities in 125 public sector hospitals and cath labs in all districts. The first phase of the International Research Institute of Ayurveda (IRIA) will be inaugurated at Kalliad, Kannur, by February 2026 to scale up the evidence-based integration of Ayurveda into global health and initiate cutting edge research on ageing and cancer, he said.

Manje Gowda, JD(S) MLC, addressing a press conference in Mysuru on January 20.\n                                          | Photo Credit: M.A. Sriram\n                                       C.N. Manje Gowda, JD(S) MLC, trained his guns on senior party leader and MLA representing Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency, G.T. Deve Gowda, accusing him of indulging in anti-party activities. Mr. Manje Gowda’s public criticism of Mr. Deve Gowda comes a day after the latter reaffirmed that he was very much in the JD(S) and will contest the coming elections from the same party. A section of party leaders from Mysuru had proposed the idea of replacing Mr. Deve Gowda as the JD(S) candidate from Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency in the next elections as the senior leader was “inactive” in the party and had not attended any party meeting for the last several months. After Mr. Deve Gowda clarified that he was committed to the JD(S) and had not spoken against the party leadership, Mr. Manje Gowda said Mr. Deve Gowda, despite winning the elections from Chamundeshwari constituency as a JD(S) candidate, had been making statements on public platforms against the party, thereby “lowering the party’s image and prestige”. The party had faced embarrassing situations at both national and State levels owing to Mr. Deve Gowda’s statements and behaviour, he said. Mr. Manje Gowda cited several examples of Mr. Deve Gowda’s alleged anti-party activities, including the latter’s campaign against him, the official JD(S) candidate for the elections to the Legislative Council from Mysuru-Chamarajanagar Local Authorities constituency, by supporting BJP candidate Raghu Kautilya. Mr. Manje Gowda also played a recording of Mr. Deve Gowda’s address during the inauguration of the Dasara festival atop Chamundi Hills in 2024 and said the latter, who defended Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in the Mysuru Urban Development Authority scam, had put party leader and Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel H.D. Kumaraswamy in an embarrassing situation by asking whether the JD(S) leader would have resigned in a similar situation.\n  Mr. Manje Gowda said he wished to ask if the senior leader is an honest party leader or an “opportunist” who can politically finish anyone for personal gain.

A number of factors, including unmotivated sanitation staff, who have had their salaries delayed, inadequate staff strength as well as uncooperative members of the public, who routinely dump waste in public spaces are contributing to the issue, claim local activists.   “Many areas within the town, including patches of reserve forest have become open dumping grounds, including Fern Hill, Gorishala, Elk Hill, Manjanakorai and the Golf Links Road. These areas, home to wildlife and minimal people movement, have turned into dumping grounds for waste from homes as well as resorts, who are unwilling to pay for waste removal from their premises,” said R. Ananth, a resident living along the Ooty lake. He says that the road to the former Deer Park has also become a dumping ground for household as well as construction waste.   “People even enter reserve forests to dump the waste. This should also be a matter of concern for the Forest Department as wildlife could be affected,” he added. Meanwhile, sanitation staff who spoke to The Hindu said that while they were understaffed, that they also have a huge task convincing uncooperative members of the public to segregate and hand over their waste during door-to-door collection drives conducted every other day across all wards in the Udhagamandalam Municipality (UMC). “While some people refuse to segregate waste, others refuse to even handover the garbage to the collection vehicles, preferring instead to dispose of it in open areas,” said a UMC worker who said that it was up to the local sanitation inspectors to levy fines against such persons, but that punishments are never imposed.   Moreover, sanitation staff have not received their salaries for the month of December, leading to a lack of motivation and absenteeism.   When contacted, a top official from the UMC said that while it was true that the December salaries for staff were delayed, they were credited to their accounts on Monday (January 19). He said that technical issues had led to salary delays for municipality staff across the State, and not just The Nilgiris. “Many people had also taken leave to go on a pilgrimage to Sabarimala, which adversely affected waste collection,” he said, adding that the UMC was taking steps to clean up areas where open dumping was occurring and impose fines on offenders.

The party sought an inquiry either by a Special Investigation Team (SIT), the CBI or the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). Telangana BJP president N. Ramchander Rao alleged that while the BRS regime ran the company ‘like a personal fiefdom’, Ministers in the present Congress government were now ‘wrangling among themselves for coal contracts’. Speaking to the media in New Delhi, the former MLC said the people of Telangana deserved clarity on the sudden cancellation of the Naini coal contract of Singareni Collieries. “How was the contract awarded in the first place, and why was it cancelled? Were the Supreme Court guidelines followed? What kind of shady deals were involved should come out,” he said. Ever since the Congress came to power, those in authority appeared interested only in ‘commissions’, seeking to award contracts and coal blocks to their ‘kith and kin’ while ignoring administration, he alleged. Mr. Rao said former BRS Minister T. Harish Rao had ‘no moral right’ to complain to Union Minister Kishan Reddy about the current imbroglio, claiming the previous government was involved in ‘many scams’ that were widely known. “Both governments made the lives of SCCL workers miserable by denying promised welfare benefits, misusing funds and delaying payments to the tune of ₹50,000 crore,” he claimed. He further alleged that while the BRS government reduced the workforce from 75,000 to 42,000, the Congress government had brought the number down further to 39,000. He cautioned against ‘playing with the lives of miners’, pointing out that the region has historically been a hotbed of revolutionary politics. Neither the Centre nor Mr. Kishan Reddy can intervene in the abrupt cancellation of the Naini coal block contract, as the State government holds 51% stake in Singareni Collieries, with Coal India owning the remaining 49%, giving the State full administrative control, he said. Mr. Rao also alleged that central investigative agencies were being ‘hamstrung’ by the Congress government’s selective permissions and restricted information sharing in the probe into the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project scam. “What is the government doing about the phone tapping issue? Why did it take two years to call Mr. Harish Rao for investigation? Both parties are indulging in shadow boxing,” he added.

Hundreds of people participated in the procession taken out to mark the event, held for the first time in Hassan, to commemorate the victory of a few hundred Mahar soldiers in a battle against the Peshwa Army at Bhima Koregaon, Maharashtra, 1818. All through the procession, which began at the Railway Station, participants carried blue flags and danced to songs that praised Dr. B.R. Ambekdar, the architect of the Indian Constitution. He highlighted the importance of the historic event by visiting Bhima Koregaon in 1927. Bhimrao Yashwant Ambedkar, a grandson of Ambedkar, was the chief guest of the event. He was taken to the venue of the convention in a specially decorated vehicle which travelled with the procession. A replica of the victory pillar that symbolised the soldiers’ victory in the battle was also carried in the procession. Mr. Yashwant Ambedkar alleged that the Union government is engaged in selling out all public sector units to private people, denying jobs to highly educated people from depressed sections. “There are many hurdles before us. Our highly qualified people are not getting jobs they deserve,” he said. He recalled the violence that occurred at Bhima Koregoan during the 200th anniversary of the victory. Those who were participating in the event were attacked by supporters of the government. “There was one positive outcome of the event. From the next day, the media highlighted the history of Bhima Koregaon,” he stated. Bharatiya Boudha Mahasabha, Dalit Samanyava Samiti, Dalit Employees Association, SC-ST Contractors Association and other like-minded organisations jointly organised the event. Senior Dalit leaders H.K. Sandesh, Ambuga Mallesh, Shreyas M. Patel, MP, and others were present.

Referring to the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025, which seeks to establish a single regulator for higher education and was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 15, 2025, before being referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee, Congress general secretary (communications) Jairam Ramesh said such a body must have a clear mandate to ensure the implementation of Article 15(5). “Any such regulator should be mandated to oversee the implementation of Article 15(5) of the Constitution, which came into effect exactly twenty years ago today,”Mr Ramesh said.   He urged the Narendra Modi-led government to fully implement Article 15(5) on the 20th anniversary of its enactment through the 93rd Constitutional Amendment by the Manmohan Singh-led UPA Government.  Calling it a historic moment, Mr. Ramesh said the amendment enabled the introduction of a 27% reservation for OBC students in Centrally-funded higher education institutions (HEIs), including the IITs, IIMs, Central Universities, and NITs. “Since then, lakhs of students from the OBC communities have availed of this reservation, bringing economic and social mobility to millions,” he said.   Article 15(5) also permits the government to mandate reservations for SC, ST and OBC students in private higher education institutions, Mr. Ramesh said, noting that its validity was upheld by the Supreme Court in the Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust vs Union of India judgment on May 6, 2014. Despite this, Parliament has not enacted any law to enforce the provision, he said. He cited an August 2025 report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, which called for legislation to mandate reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs in private higher educational institutions, pointing to their “abysmally and unacceptably low” representation.

Pawan Kalyan asks all government departments to prepare detailed and time-bound action plans. \n                                          | Photo Credit: File Photo  \n                                       The Andhra Pradesh government is all set to roll out its ambitious 50 per cent Green Cover Project from Ugadi, marking a major push towards long-term environmental sustainability. The government has placed green growth at the core of its development agenda, with a long-term vision of achieving 50 per cent green cover in the State by 2047.  As an intermediate goal, the government aims to increase green cover to 37 per cent by 2030, Deputy Chief Minister Pawan Kalyan said. Chairing a high-level review meeting at the Secretariat in Velagapudi on Tuesday, the Deputy Chief Minister directed all government departments to prepare detailed, time-bound action plans before Ugadi, underlining that the target cannot be achieved without collective administrative commitment.  Currently, Andhra Pradesh has around 30 per cent green cover, requiring an additional seven per cent increase over the next four years.  To achieve this goal, plantation activities must be undertaken across nearly 9 lakh hectares, with a total long-term requirement of plantations in 32.6 lakh acres. Each department has been assigned specific responsibilities, with the Horticulture Department expected to contribute nearly 12 per cent of the total saplings, he said. Stressing ecological sensitivity, Mr. Pawan Kalyan instructed the officials to prioritise native and climate-resilient plant species. Industrial corridors will be developed with pollution-absorbing trees, while species tolerant to cyclones and salt will be planted along the coast. Fruit-bearing trees will be promoted on farmers’ lands, canal bunds and tank embankments to ensure sustainable income generation, alongwith environmental protection. Plantation along the national and state highways will be made mandatory, and all departments have been asked to align their efforts with the Great Green Wall project, particularly along the 970-acre coastal stretch, a significant portion of which falls under the Forest Department.  “Every sapling planted must serve both environmental protection and public welfare,” Mr. Pawan Kalyan said. Senior officials from the forest, agriculture, irrigation, urban development departments and APIIC participated in the meeting.

A memorandum in this regard was submitted to the Regional Commissioner in Mysuru. Samiti president Hallikerihundi Bhagyaraj alleged that illegal constructions have come up in the Kabini backwater region, elephant corridors, tiger reserve areas, forest buffer zones and environmentally sensitive zones (ESZ) in violation of the Forest Act, Wildlife Protection Act and irrigation laws. He said the operation of these establishments was affecting wildlife, forcing animals to stray into villages in search of food and safety. “As a result, incidents of human–animal conflict have increased, creating fear among agricultural labourers, farmers and villagers living on the forest fringes,” he said in a press release. Around four farmers have already lost their lives. Tiger attacks have spread to rural areas and attacks on cattle continue unabated, he added. He demanded that a high-level meeting be convened immediately under the leadership of Mysuru district in-charge Minister along with the Forest, Revenue and Tourism Ministers to discuss and address the issue. He also demanded that a committee, headed by a sitting judge, be constituted to prepare a report on legal and illegal constructions, and take measures that safeguard farmers and the persons living on the forest fringes. He warned that the Samiti will be forced to launch an agitation if the government fails to convene a meeting and address the issue immediately.

Of these, 54 special trains originated from the Vijayawada division, 56 terminated within the division, and 144 passed through Vijayawada. “All the officers, supervisors, station staff, pointsmen, guards, loco pilots, engineering and signal staff worked in tandem and operated trains by maintaining punctuality and safety,” said Vijayawada Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Mohit Sonakiya on Tuesday (January 20, 2026). “The tireless efforts of the officers and employees of all departments helped lakhs of passengers reach their destinations safely during the peak period,” the DRM said and appreciated the railwaymen for rising to the occasion. Officers and staff of major stations, including Vijayawada and Rajahmundry worked round the clock and took precautions in regulation of trains, platform management, crowd control and signalling coordination. The 254 special trains were operated between January 10 and 20, in addition to the regular 262 trains being run in the division, including eight Vande Bharat, 85 passenger and 112 express and superfast and 57 non-daily services, said Vijayawada division public relations officer Nusrat M. Mandrupkar.  Published - January 20, 2026 07:00 pm IST \n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Raising slogans against both the State and the Union governments, the protesters demanded the establishment of exclusive red gram procurement centres on the lines of milk producers cooperative societies under the Karnataka Milk Federation model. They sought a minimum support price (MSP) of ₹12,500 per quintal of red gram, contending that the current market prices are far below the cost of cultivation. Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha district president Sharanabasappa Mamshetty demanded that the State government provide a production incentive of ₹1,000 per quintal, along with an additional incentive of ₹1,000 per quintal from the Union government, to ensure remunerative returns for farmers. They called for the imposition of a 50% import duty on imported red gram, saying that large-scale imports are depressing domestic prices. Mr. Mamshetty urged the district authorities to immediately commence procurement of red gram to prevent distress sales by farmers. He also demanded settlement of crop insurance claims, saying that delays have compounded financial distress of farmers. All India Kisan Sabha district president Bheemashankar Madiyal and All India Kisan Khet Mazdoor Sangathan district secretary S.B. Mahesh demanded waiver of agricultural loans by nationalised banks, citing the mounting debt burden on farmers. They warned that the continued neglect of the agrarian crisis might lead to an increase in farmer suicides. The agitators will launch a 24-hour protest outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office on Thursday, they said.

Ravi’s address that was deemed to have been read out in the Assembly on Tuesday.   (Though the Governor declined to read out the prepared speech and walked out, the House adopted a resolution that the speech prepared by the State government and sent to him would be considered as having been read out by him in the House.) Referring to the new programme, the address said it “undermined the fundamental objective of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme”, a programme intended to ensure wage employment for crores of poor and underprivileged people in rural areas, particularly women and the Adi Dravidar communities. Tamil Nadu had consistently received several national awards for its successful implementation. “The discontinuation of this scheme not only hinders development in rural areas but also aggravates the financial strain on the State government. Owing to the new scheme, VB-G RAM-G, the financial burden on Tamil Nadu will further increase by approximately ₹5,000 crore per annum,” the address said. Given that the State had been facing significant challenges in implementing its own schemes owing to the increased State share under various Central government-sponsored programmes, the introduction of this new scheme “must be viewed as part of the Union government’s adverse intent,” it said.  “Therefore, we urge the Union government to withdraw this new scheme and come forward for allocating further financial resources for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for its successful implementation.”  According to the address, the Tamil Nadu government accorded high priority to the safety of Tamil Nadu fishermen. While fishing in the traditional fishing areas of the Palk Bay, the fishermen who “lose their way and inadvertently enter Sri Lankan waters” were often apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy under the pretext of crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line. “Although they are subsequently released through the efforts of the State and Union governments, they endure imprisonment, and even after release, their fishing boats are often not returned. This causes severe hardship to them.” “This government urges the Union government to make coordinated efforts to revive the Joint Working Group and initiate talks to address this long-standing issue, and to make concerted efforts to arrive at a mutually acceptable and sustainable solution,” it added.
