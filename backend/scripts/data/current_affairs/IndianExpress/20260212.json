The incident took place around 7 am when miscreants torched two houses in Litan Sareikhong village, raising fresh concerns about the security situation in the entire district despite massive security deployment, including of central and state forces. Police also said that gunshots were heard around 8 am, but there were no reports of any casualties or arrests.\nTension has been simmering in the Litan area since Sunday night after an alleged drunken brawl between a few people from neighbouring villages escalated. So far, over 40 houses belonging to the Tankhul Naga and Kuki communities have been burnt down in the violence. The district authorities had imposed an indefinite curfew in and around the Litan area to de-escalate the situation, followed by shutting down of internet services in the entire district. Meanwhile, women from the Vaiphei community in Kuki-Zo-dominated Churachandpur district organised a protest rally expressing discontentment over MLA LM Khaute participating in Manipur government formation. The protest was mobilised by the Vaiphei Women Association. The protestors assembled at Vaiphei Peoples Council hall in Dorcas Veng and marched towards the residence of the MLA. Rapid Action Forces fired a few blank shots to disperse the protestors, sources said. Carrying placards, the protestors raised slogans and blocked the road before being dispersed around 12.45 pm. Opposing the participation of Kuki-Zo MLAs in Manipur government formation, the Kuki Women Organisation for Human Rights had also organised a public rally last week in Churachandpur and other Kuki-Zo inhabited areas.

    "full_text": "“India is certainly part of the leading pack of countries investing in AI and getting ready to adopt it at scale,” says Pascal Bourguet, Global Channel Chief and Chief Operating Officer, International Markets, Lenovo, at an event in Delhi on Thursday. Bourguet’s statement sets the tone for how the world views India, as global tech giants continue to invest billions of dollars in a nation that is rapidly building its AI infrastructure. While still at a nascent stage, India’s data centre industry is growing fast, with companies considering it the backbone of the country’s digital future. Bourguet cites India’s massive population of 1.5 billion, which creates enormous local data demand and low-latency requirements, with millions of young people already having free or discounted access to AI platforms. He adds that enterprises — both large and small — prefer to keep data closer to their headquarters for speed, security, and legal compliance. Data sovereignty, he says, is becoming increasingly critical for AI model governance and privacy. “There is very strong AI demand globally, driven primarily by hyperscalers from both a hardware and services standpoint. Over the past year to year and a half, demand has also been driven by tier-2 cloud providers, which we call ‘neo clouds’. Between the hyperscalers and the neo clouds, it is true that, from a products and services perspective, they are currently driving the vast majority of demand for Lenovo’s products and solutions,” Bourguet told indianexpress.com in an interview at the Lenovo Tech World India Edition. To fuel growth in artificial intelligence, major tech companies are building hyperscale campuses across the heartland, turning farmlands and barren factories into data centres — essentially computing farms. Simply put, the AI boom cannot happen without data centres. While data centres are being built across the world, India wants a slice of the opportunity and is wooing major tech companies to develop large-scale AI data centres in the country. India’s current data centre capacity is roughly 1.2 gigawatts, but the market is set to more than double, crossing 3 gigawatts within the next five years, according to industry estimates. Part of the reason global data centre companies are keen to enter India is the growth the country is witnessing, along with its massive internet penetration. Many of these facilities are being planned at the gigawatt scale, often by “hyperscalers” — companies that consume vast amounts of computing power. For context, one gigawatt equals 1,000 megawatts, and one megawatt equals 1 million watts. Investments to build these data centres run into billions of dollars, even as the AI boom, which has sparked fears of a potential bubble, with returns on investment still relatively low for now. But at the heart of the AI boom is the potential demand for artificial intelligence and rising AI workloads from enterprises. According to one estimate, 60 per cent of data centre clients are enterprises, 30 per cent are hyperscalers, and AI users account for only about 10 per cent. Bourguet estimates that Indian enterprises currently have around 300 to 500 AI factories, driven by partners, signalling the early-stage adoption of AI in the country. He foresees further growth as enterprises move from project assessments to full-scale AI deployment and application adoption. As many enterprises recognise the need to deploy AI including their own generative AI applications, they are realising the requirement for new hardware infrastructure. In response, companies like Lenovo are launching specialised servers and AI supercomputing cloud services to meet that demand. “Particularly when we look across certain verticals, we see CxOs highlighting that they are planning to invest five times more in AI. The standout sectors are government, telecom, and healthcare. Beyond the natural demand in India, I think the Indian Government has also been making a strong push,” said Fan Ho, Executive Director & General Manager, Asia Pacific Solutions & Services Group, adding that sovereign AI is a key theme in the Asia-Pacific region, emphasising local data control and compute capacity. Both Bourguet and Ho agree that India has a large pool of engineers skilled in machine learning and data science, along with the technical support required to scale enterprise AI. Citing International Data Corporation data, Bourguet said system integrators are expected to capture around 50 per cent of the enterprise AI market share. While it is still early days for AI adoption, most enterprise IT organisations once viewed AI and the deployment of AI infrastructure as part of a long-term strategy. However, generative AI has accelerated that shift, and many are now beginning to see tangible benefits. “Historically, major data centre hubs have closely aligned and coexisted with the points of presence of telecommunications networks. That was the phenomenon around a decade ago. This is why you typically see so-called mature markets in the Asia-Pacific region emerging as scale centres — Japan, Australia, and broadly China. However, in the AI era, two major things have changed. This is also why India has been moving ahead rapidly over the last one to two years,” Ho said. For Ho, “data” is the nutrient that powers AI models. As a result, governance, data protection, and privacy considerations have become central issues. “We are therefore seeing increasing localisation of infrastructure to cater to these requirements,” she said, adding that hyperscalers and new cloud providers are stepping in to bridge the demand gap. “More organisations are experimenting with and pushing the boundaries of AI use cases. This is driving demand because, ultimately, if you are doing advanced AI research or deploying AI-driven solutions, you need massive compute power. Whether it is research, building management systems, or industry-wide AI applications, the need for compute infrastructure is expanding across virtually every sector,” she added. India offers several advantages for large-scale data centre development, including strong local demand, the rise of e-commerce, and new rules requiring social media data to be stored locally. However, experts warn that India will need large quantities of power and water, even though land is not a major constraint. Once data centres begin to scale, India will also need to carefully balance environmental concerns. Ho says Lenovo’s Neptune warm water cooling technology reduces power and water usage by using a closed-loop warm water cooling system instead of chilled water and traditional air conditioning units. Additionally, it cuts total power consumption by reducing reliance on heavy air conditioning and helps address resource constraints while supporting high GPU heat dissipation. Lenovo held its Tech World event in India a few days ahead of the India AI Impact Summit, a keenly followed event being held in Delhi. The summit will see thousands of participants and is drawing leaders from more than 100 countries, including a dozen heads of state, several dozen ministers or country representatives, and chief executive officers of leading global and Indian firms.

    "full_text": "For years, the decline of parliamentary standards in the country has been lamented. The passage of Bills without adequate or no discussion, the din during discussions, MPs rushing to the Well, the throwing of papers at each other, proceedings stalled for days on end, and allegations of partisanship against the presiding officers. All this has become commonplace.  And yet, by any standard, the present crisis gripping Parliament is unprecedented. There is a notice, signed by 118 Opposition MPs, to move a no-confidence motion against the Lok Sabha Speaker. The Opposition may not be able to get the motion passed, given the numbers weigh heavily in favour of the ruling party, but it does raise questions about the credibility of the Speaker, something the Opposition had avoided over the years.  It was also unprecedented for Birla to admit that he had advised Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to come to the Lok Sabha to reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President’s Address. Birla said he had “concrete” information that “many members of the Congress party could carry out an unexpected act by reaching the spot where the prime minister sits”. In other words, the Speaker was apprehensive that the PM could be attacked and that it was not safe for him to attend the proceedings. This admission was startling.  The second implication was that the government was not in a position to protect the PM in the Lok Sabha. Since mid-2024, the Central Industrial Security Force, and not the Watch and Ward staff, has been looking after Parliament security. If the PM is really not safe in the Lok Sabha, that is serious business.  The Opposition blamed the government for “managing the headlines“, as Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi had cited former Army chief General M M Naravane’s unpublished book, “Four Stars of Destiny”, when attempting to question the Centre over the face-off with the Chinese military in eastern Ladakh in 2020.  With Penguin Random House clarifying that the book had not been published and General Naravane endorsing the publisher’s position, the situation has become more explosive. It has been complicated by an FIR registered that has turned the discussion from the contents of the book to how Gandhi came to possess it.  On Thursday, a day after Gandhi addressed the House on the Union Budget, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey submitted a notice to move a substantive motion against the LoP for engaging in “anti-India activities”. Dubey has called for the cancellation of Gandhi’s Lok Sabha membership and demanded that he be barred from contesting elections for life. Bitterness has crept in These developments have had a bearing on the dignity of two prime institutions of Parliament — the LoP and the Speaker — and underscore once again the breakdown of trust between the ruling side and the Opposition that has rendered Parliament dysfunctional. The bitterness that has come to vitiate the relationship between the two sides makes dialogue that much more difficult. While the government has to ensure Parliament runs smoothly, it is not possible without the cooperation of the Opposition, or without civility in public discourse, which is becoming a casualty.  It is not as if disruptions are new to Parliament. A sight indelibly etched in my mind is of Home Minister Indrajit Gupta, sometime in 1996, sitting near the entrance to Parliament’s Central Hall, holding his head in his hands and exuding helplessness after the shenanigans in the House.   The coalition era (1989-2014) also saw contention convulse Parliament time and again. Regional parties had become national players; their MPs would often stall Parliament to send a message to their party chiefs that they were agitating for the state in Delhi. I remember how RJD MPs opposed the Lokpal Bill in the Rajya Sabha in December 2011, with one of them tearing the Bill and throwing it in the House. RJD chief Lalu Prasad sat in the visitors’ gallery that day, hawk-like, to see how his MPs were faring.   In 2016, a riled President Pranab Mukherjee had upbraided MPs to get on with business. “For God’s sake, do your job,” he told the protesting members.  In the past, when the House became uproarious, the presiding officers used to adjourn proceedings and call leaders from the ruling side and the Opposition parties to their chamber to persuade them to exercise restraint and “find a way out”. These attempts often succeeded because the presiding officers still exercised a kind of moral authority. Besides, there were leaders on both sides of the aisle who believed in the sanctity of Parliament and wanted it to function. Where is parliamentary democracy headed? Where then is our parliamentary democracy headed? The answers have to come from within Parliament.  While Parliament has been a witness to many a stirring speech over the years, the essence of what the relationship between the ruling side and the Opposition should be was captured in the words of BJP leader Sushma Swaraj, then the LoP, in 2014. Swaraj made the speech during the last sitting of the 15th Lok Sabha, just before the House dissolved for elections that turned out to be historic.   “Bhai Kamal Nath,” Swaraj said in her inimitable style, “apni shararat se is sadan ko uljha dete the, aur adarniya Shinde ji (Sushil Kumar Shinde) apni sharafat se use suljha dete the.” (My brother Kamal Nath used to leave this House in tangles with his mischief, and the respected Shinde ji used to untangle it with his decency.) Swaraj then went on to compliment Sonia Gandhi, whose possible elevation as PM she had once opposed by threatening to tonsure her head. Swaraj thanked Sonia for her “mediatory role” during times of crisis, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his “gentleness”, Speaker Meira Kumar for her “tolerance” (of different views), and L K Advani’s “nyayapriyata (sense of fair play)”, all of which had contributed to the functioning of the House despite problems. But the core sentiment at the heart of Indian democracy, Swaraj said, was that “while we are opponents, we are not enemies”. That made it possible for relationships to be maintained despite ideological and programmatic differences.  Those words resound even today, as relevant for our divided democracy as they were 12 years ago.

    "full_text": "Airport fashion has increasingly become a space where comfort meets quiet luxury, and Kareena Kapoor Khan’s recent Mumbai airport appearance is a perfect example of this shift. Dressed in a relaxed, travel-ready outfit, the actor leaned into ease and practicality. But it was her choice of accessories that subtly elevated the entire look and drew attention from many. While her rust-red sweatshirt, wide-leg denim jeans, and practical tote spoke to effortless travel style, the standout detail was the luxury timepiece on her wrist. Kareena was spotted wearing the Jaeger-LeCoultre Rendez-Vous Classic Night & Day watch, a refined design known for its understated elegance, delicate proportions, and meticulous craftsmanship. According to the Swiss watchmaker, “With its jewelled finish, the Rendez-Vous Night & Day timepiece in steel is a beautiful expression of the Rendez-Vous collection, created for women by Jaeger-LeCoultre.” On Kareena, the watch quietly highlighted how luxury today often makes its statement without loud branding. The popular Instagram page for horology enthusiasts, @theindianhorology, estimates the price at $12,600, approximately ₹12.4 lakhs. However, Jaeger-LeCoultre mentions that the price is “available upon request.” The timepiece reflects a blend of traditional watchmaking and modern wearability, from its compact 29 mm case and mother-of-pearl dial to its automatic in-house movement and subtle diamond detailing. Rather than overpowering her outfit, the watch complemented the overall look, highlighting how high-end accessories can seamlessly fit into everyday wardrobes. To learn more about this luxury timepiece, indianexpress.com reached out to an expert to discuss luxury watches as daily wear, how craftsmanship influences value, and why certain timepieces transcend trends to become long-term style investments rather than occasional showpieces. Mehul Bhagwani, watch enthusiast and digital growth marketer, tells indianexpress.com, “At first glance, the Rendez-Vous Classic Night and Day looks delicate. Diamonds, mother of pearl, soft curves. It gives the impression that it belongs in a jewellery box, not real life. But that assumption falls apart pretty quickly once you understand how it is built.”     A post shared by THEINDIANHOROLOGY (@theindianhorology)  He explains that the case is stainless steel, the glass is sapphire, and the movement is designed to withstand everyday shocks, temperature changes, and long hours on the wrist. “This is not a fragile accessory. It is closer to a daily companion that just happens to look elegant.” The day-and-night display adds charm, Bhagwani notes, but it is also genuinely useful if you travel or deal with people in different time zones. “The best way to describe it is simple. It does the hard work quietly and looks polished while doing it.” According to Bhagwani, when a watch brand designs and builds its own movement, it changes the entire equation. “You are not buying a shell with borrowed parts inside. You are buying something that was thought through from the inside out. That matters for accuracy, serviceability, and long-term value. Size plays a role, too. A modest case size does not chase trends, which means it will not feel dated a few years down the line. Steel is practical and ages well. Diamonds, when done with restraint, do not wear out or lose relevance.” He adds, “Straps can be replaced. Movements can be serviced. The core of the watch is designed to last decades, not seasons. That is why pieces like this often get passed down rather than replaced.” There is a noticeable shift happening in how people wear luxury. Bhagwani states, “Loud branding and obvious flex pieces are starting to feel unnecessary, sometimes even uncomfortable. Especially when travelling or moving through everyday spaces.” The appeal now is in subtlety. Bhagwani confirms, “Wearing something that most people overlook, but someone who knows watches immediately recognises. The Rendez-Vous does this through finishing, proportion, and detail, not logos or attention-seeking design.” \n\r\n📣 For more lifestyle news,  click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram  At a panel hosted by the Tuli Research Centre, Saeed Mirza, Dibakar Banerjee and Gurvinder Singh reflect on identity, shrinking freedoms and the role of filmmakers in today’s times.",

For a few seconds he tries to get Farhan’s attention by screaming his lungs out. When the opener turns back, he relays a message that would be mentioned in Pakistan’s dressing room, in the days leading up to their match against India. “Farhan bhai iss baar Bumrah ko chakke marke bhatheese (32 hours) ki film banayenge. Chodna math.” With a smile, Farhan gave him a thumbs up. There is a reason beyond their dressing room why the whole of Pakistan is counting on Farhan against India. In three outings against India – all in last year’s Asia Cup – he has scores of 40, 58 and 57. These may not be huge scores, but how he has got them is what will even make India’s think tank dedicate a lot of time on the right-hander. For, Farhan has done what few other batsmen in the world has– to counterpunch Jasprit Bumrah and unsettle him in the first spell. In three innings, Farhan has scored 51 runs against Bumrah at a strike rate of 150. It includes six boundaries and three sixes without being dismissed. Before heading to Colombo for the T20 World Cup, in a response to a question on employing aggression from both ends, Farhan spilled his game plan, which explains why he didn’t hesitate to take on Bumrah. “In international cricket you can’t attack from both ends all the time. But I feel, it is very important to attack their main bowler whosoever it is. If you do that, you will put him under pressure and also the opposition. If I do that it will help other batsmen as well,” Farhan told Pakistan Cricket.

Be it Ahmedabad or New York, Bumrah has cracked opened the game with his artistry similar to how Pakistan’s wondrous seamers had subjected Indian batsmen during their good old days. Hence, Farhan’s success hasn’t gone unnoticed. Last year, despite Pakistan losing the Asia Cup final to India, when Farhan returned to his hometown Charsadda in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, thousands mobbed his car. Some got on top of the car bonnet, some tried to climb atop his sedan and Farhan pleaded with folded hands not to with a smile. He also has a persona to match his batting. He has that feisty alley-cat persona, to be unfazed by crisis, to stand up in tough times and handle the tough jobs that endears to the public. Even on the field, he isn’t a fiery batsman. Though his gunfire celebration against India added to the tension between the two teams and he subsequently received one demerit point, there is more to Farhan than that. For starters, his batting is not complicated. It mostly goes on the lines of ‘see ball, hit ball’ but what stands out is the position he gets under to pull of those. In the Asia Cup, among the shots that he hit off Bumrah, which included a pull and a cut, one stood out. To the pacer’s stock delivery that comes in with the angle, batsmen often struggle when it comes to deciding whether to go forward or play him from the back. But Farhan, just cleared his front leg and lofted him high over mid-wicket. He got another boundary via same shot. He tried the slower-ball cutter in the final, but got the same treatment. Not the strongest square on the off-side, Farhan prefers to go straight by standing rooted in the crease. Unlike Shahid Afridi, he doesn’t prefer to come down the track. Unlike him, he doesn’t bring cross-batted shots that adds risks. Having to take a high-risk approach, his intention is to rely on his strengths – which is to hit straight and in the mid-wicket region. “In T20s, there is very little to plan. You have to identify your strengths and make the most out of it. In cricket, you will obviously hit the bad deliveries, but our intention in the powerplay is to maximise the field restrictions. You have to keep looking for opportunities and when you get a chance, you have to make full use of it irrespective of the risk involved,” Farhan said. ALSO READ | Pakistan’s X-factor: A multifaceted spin bowling unit that can trouble India’s big-hitters This clarity arrives from the hard yards Farhan put in the domestic circuit. In first-class cricket he averages 44.82 with 10 centuries. But it took him some exceptional batting in the domestic T20 tournament and the PSL to get a national call-up again in 2024, a good six years after making his debut. In practice sessions, Farhan has invariably stood out when it comes to the number of times the support staff shout ‘watch out’ when he sends the ball high and soaring into the Colombo skies. Primarily a middle-order batsman, Farhan has been handed the opening role because of his struggles to rotate the strike.  Having seen his six-hitting capabilities, one of the first things that coach Mike Hesson did when he took charge of the team was to make Farhan open. It has meant, Pakistan have been able to maximise the powerplay with Farhan and his partner Saim Ayub given the license to play with intent. While Ayub still has some distance to cover, Farhan is breathing consistently. Asked about the prospect of facing Bumrah again, Farhan said: “When you score runs, you’re very confident. I’m confident, too. Come Sunday, this could be a match-up that could well define the outcome. Stay updated with the latest sports news across Cricket, Football, Chess, and more.

    "full_text": "Anthropic is widening access to its AI chatbot Claude by adding several new features to its free plan, a move that comes at a time when competition in the AI space is heating up. The update follows recent changes by OpenAI, which introduced ads to its free and lower-cost ChatGPT plans. That decision sparked debate among users and prompted rivals to respond. Anthropic even ran high-profile ads during the Super Bowl, making it clear that Claude would remain ad-free. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman later said the company did not plan to hide its best tools behind a paywall. Now, Anthropic appears to be making its own statement by bringing some previously paid features to Claude’s free tier. However, for users who were not sure whether they need the paid AI services of Anthropic, the enhanced free option might even make the situation uncertain. Anthropic has made its services richer with features previously only accessible with the paid option. One of the biggest additions is file creation. Free users are now able to create and save PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, and PDFs directly from their conversations with Claude. That will make it easier to turn ideas, reports, or summaries into ready files without switching between multiple apps. Anthropic has also introduced select Connectors to the free plan. These tools allow Claude to work with certain external services, including Google Workspace apps. Previously, Connectors were only available to paying subscribers. Bringing them into the free tier opens up more use cases, practically for students and professionals who live on Google Docs, Sheets, and similar tools. Another feature that has moved out from behind the paywall is Custom Skills. Skills are a set of specific instructions that users can set up for Claude to follow in future interactions. Instead of having to make the same detailed request every time, users can create a Skill once and then reuse it. This is particularly helpful for users who use the chatbot for recurring tasks like drafting emails, summarizing documents, or brainstorming ideas. Anthropic is also extending conversation length for free users, allowing for more back-and-forth without hitting limits too quickly. Interactive responses have been improved, and the company says image and voice search capabilities have been enhanced as well. While some may see longer conversations as the standout upgrade, the overall package adds clear value to the free plan. At a time when ad-supported AI tools are becoming more common, Claude’s ad-free approach and expanded feature set could appeal to users looking for an alternative.    At a panel hosted by the Tuli Research Centre, Saeed Mirza, Dibakar Banerjee and Gurvinder Singh reflect on identity, shrinking freedoms and the role of filmmakers in today’s times.",

    "full_text": "CBSE Board Exams 2026: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will hold a live webcast for school principals and heads of institutions on February 14, 2026, from 3 pm to 4 pm, as per an official notice issued by the Board. The session will be conducted online and will focus on modalities related to the conduct of the 2026 board examinations and evaluation processes. The CBSE Board examinations 2026 for Classes 10 and 12 are set to begin on February 17. While the Class 10 examinations will conclude on March 11, the Class 12 examinations will end on April 10. Approximately 46 lakh students from India and 26 other countries are expected to appear for the examinations this year. The Board has stated that the webcast is being organised to ensure clarity and uniformity in the conduct of examinations and evaluation. With a large number of candidates appearing across centres in India and abroad, CBSE has emphasised the need for coordinated implementation of examination guidelines and evaluation procedures. The session is also aimed at briefing school heads on new initiatives introduced this year and on measures to ensure error-free and timely evaluation of answer scripts. The CBSE webcast on the dual-exam scheme for Class 10 and the introduction of On-Screen Marking (OSM) will be streamed live through the official CBSE YouTube channel, as mentioned in the notice. Principals and heads of schools have been instructed to access the session using the direct YouTube link shared by the Board and ensure they log in at the scheduled time. This year, CBSE has introduced several changes in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and stakeholder feedback. The Board has also updated Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for evaluation. It has reduced the number of answer books allotted per evaluator to allow more time for quality assessment. Capacity building programmes for evaluators have been planned, along with short instructional videos to guide them. Evaluation is scheduled to be completed within eight to 10 days, compared to 10–12 days in previous years. In a separate communication to schools, CBSE said that error-free evaluation depends on the “devotion, sincerity and availability of qualified evaluators.” Principals and school managements have been directed to relieve teachers immediately upon receiving instructions from the Regional Office. Teachers are to be relieved full-time for all days of evaluation in their subject. Relieving certificates must be issued as per the prescribed annexure. The notice states that principals must relieve teachers with full responsibility, ensuring that they are qualified and competent under CBSE norms. Schools have also been asked to relieve teachers in proportion to the number of students sponsored for Board examinations. The Board clarified that relieving teachers after completion of evaluation will be the responsibility of the Chief Nodal Supervisor, who will issue the relevant relieving certificates. CBSE warned that non-compliance would invite strict action. Any deviation will be treated as an attempt to vitiate the evaluation process. The results of the school may not be declared in case of non-adherence. Further action may be taken under the Examination and Affiliation Bye-Laws of the Board. Stressing collective responsibility, CBSE said that if any student suffers due to non-compliance, schools must remember that the student is their own and it is their duty to ensure fairness and accuracy in evaluation. With the introduction of on-screen marking for Class 12 and tighter monitoring of evaluator deployment, the Board has signalled a shift towards standardised and technology-driven assessment, while reinforcing accountability at the school level ahead of the 2026 examinations.    At a panel hosted by the Tuli Research Centre, Saeed Mirza, Dibakar Banerjee and Gurvinder Singh reflect on identity, shrinking freedoms and the role of filmmakers in today’s times.",

Called “Dear Algo,” the tool allows people to directly tell the app what kind of content they want more or less of in their feed. The idea is simple. If a user wants to tweak their feed, they can publish a public post starting with the words “Dear Algo,” followed by their request. For instance, someone interested in podcasts could write, “Dear Algo, show me more posts about podcasts.” Threads will then adjust that user’s feed based on the request for the next three days. Unlike traditional settings buried inside menus, Dear Algo works openly. Because the request is posted publicly, other users can see it. They can also repost the same request to apply similar changes to their own feeds. While some may not be comfortable sharing their preferences so openly, Meta says the public approach is intentional. The company believes it can help users discover trending topics and join larger conversations, turning personalisation into something more social. Threads says the feature is built for moments when interests shift quickly. In a blog post, the company noted that while Threads aims to help users keep up with what’s happening in real time, personal priorities can change just as fast. Someone might want more updates during a live NBA game, for example, or fewer spoilers about a TV series they have not yet watched. Dear Algo is meant to reflect those short-term changes without permanently reshaping a feed. Most social platforms, including X and Bluesky, already offer “Not Interested” options that let users hide specific posts or topics. Dear Algo goes a step further by allowing people to actively steer the algorithm in a specific direction, even if only temporarily. This could also help Threads strengthen its image as a real-time platform, an area where X has traditionally held strong ground. The feature is currently available in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Threads says it plans to expand access to more countries in the coming months. The launch comes shortly after a report from market intelligence firm Similarweb showed Threads surpassing X in daily mobile usage. As of January 7, 2026, Threads recorded 141.5 million daily active users on mobile, compared to X’s 125 million.    At a panel hosted by the Tuli Research Centre, Saeed Mirza, Dibakar Banerjee and Gurvinder Singh reflect on identity, shrinking freedoms and the role of filmmakers in today’s times.",

    "full_text": "The India-US trade deal, which is expected to be signed next month, will also have provisions on the lines of the one in the Bangladesh-US deal that allows limited quality of Indian textile and clothing to be exported to the US at zero reciprocal duty, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday. This comes amid concerns among Indian garment manufacturers that Indian products would continue to face an 18% disadvantage compared to Bangladeshi exports after Dhaka struck a fresh US trade deal this week, following the announcement of an agreement between New Delhi and Washington. “Bangladesh has received a benefit under its trade deal with the US of exporting textiles and garments [in quota] at zero reciprocal duty if they purchase raw material from the US. India has a similar benefit [under its trade deal with the US]. The fine print of the India-US deal will have details,” Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told reporters here. As per the Bangladesh-US joint statement, the US committed to “establishing a mechanism” that will allow for certain textile and apparel goods from Bangladesh to receive a zero reciprocal tariff rate. This mechanism will allow imports of a “to-be-specified volume of apparel and textile” from Bangladesh to enter the United States at this reduced tariff rate, the statement read. The provisions allowing zero reciprocal duty market access also said that the volume of duty-free textile and apparel products from Bangladesh to the US would be determined on the basis of Dhaka’s imports of “U.S.-produced cotton and man-made fibre textile inputs” from Washington. Bangladesh is the second largest exporter of textiles and apparel goods after China. The zero reciprocal duty provision in the India-US trade deal could prove to be a larger advantage for Indian textile and garments, as New Delhi has significantly larger spinning capacity than Dhaka, which means India has higher utilisation of US cotton and hence could get a bigger quota under the provision. Cotton spinning is the process of twisting strands of cotton fibres to form a yarn, which is used to make apparel and other end-user products. The Indian spinning industry is one of the biggest industries globally, and Bangladesh is a key importer of Indian yarn. The share of Indian textile exporters such as Gokuldas Exports, KPR Mills and Arvind Ltd that had slipped up to 7% on Monday following the joint statement, recovered on Thursday and closed up to 4% higher on Thursday after Goyal’s comments. Notably, Bangladesh is also pushing for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union after India gained a competitive edge in the textile sector with a trade agreement with the European bloc and the UK. In 2024, India accounted for around 5% of the EU’s textile and apparel imports, while China led the pack (28%), followed by Bangladesh (22%), Turkey (11%), Vietnam (6%), and India. Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, on February 1, called for an early start to FTA negotiations with the European Union, after graduating from Least Developed Country (LDC) status. The change of status will result in the country losing a few trade concessions. To get an exemption for its textile industry, a priority sector, Bangladesh accepted steep asks from the US. Dhaka agreed to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of US agriculture products, including wheat, soy, cotton, corn and energy products, with an estimated value of $15 billion over 15 years. According to the agreement, Bangladesh agreed to “allow imports of U.S. dairy products of bovine, ovine, and caprine origins when accompanied by a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) dairy sanitary certificate”. Notably, India has kept dairy out of the India-US trade deal- a long-standing red line for New Delhi in trade negotiations. Bangladesh also accepted several US standards under the trade agreement as the deal stated that “Bangladesh shall recognise “USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) oversight of U.S. meat and poultry (including offal), meat and poultry products, processed meat and poultry, Siluriformes, and egg product facilities.. ” Dhaka has also accepted a slew of labour-related commitments that the US has been pushing for in trade deals. The agreement said that “Bangladesh shall resolve or withdraw, as appropriate, pending criminal cases filed against garment workers and labour leaders for engaging in legitimate union and protest activities, including pending criminal cases stemming from the 2023 minimum wage labour unrest”. The terms of the US-Bangladesh agreement said: “Nothing in this Agreement shall constrain, or otherwise prevent, a Party from imposing additional tariffs to remedy unfair trade practices, to address import surges, to protect its economic or national security, or for other similar reasons consistent with its law”.

Let’s have a look at these railway projects that are set to provide faster train journeys, higher freight efficiency, improved safety and economic growth: The national transporter has sanctioned the construction of a third line between Aunrihar and Varanasi City under North Eastern Railway. The project will be developed at an estimated cost of Rs 497.07 crore. Upon completion, current line capacity, now at 87.93 per cent will increase to over 102 per cent, significantly reducing congestion, improving punctuality, and supporting smoother travel for millions of passengers. The doubling of the 50.06 km long Ringas–Sikar section in Rajasthan under North Western Railway will be completed at an estimated cost of Rs 470.34 crore. With an anticipated five additional trains per direction each day and freight traffic increase of 2.36 MTPA, this project will improve reliability and line speeds for both passenger and freight services. The Ujjain bypass line project connecting Naikheri to Chintaman Ganesh will be developed at an estimated cost of Rs 189.04 crore. It will provide a strategic diversion that removes the need for train reversals at Ujjain Junction, substantially improving sectional capacity and operational efficiency. The Katihar Division of Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) will construct a road over bridge at Level Crossing No. 101 between Malahar Halt and Samsi. The move will eliminate traffic bottlenecks, reduce road–rail conflicts, and significantly improve safety for motorists, pedestrians, and emergency services.

    "full_text": "On the 55 acres of land where workers are busy restoring rows of neat cottages with terracotta-tiled roofs as part of the Rs 1,200 crore Sabarmati Ashram Redevelopment Project, one cottage on the north-west corner stands untouched. Clothes hang on a line, a scooter is parked outside, the walls are stained with water leakage, the lime plaster has peeled off at places exposing the bricks, and the roof tiles are run down or broken. But the family of the late Mohanbhai Rathod is holding out on the government’s rehabilitation plan and resisting moving out, unlike the other 250-odd families which once lived on the premises. The Dalit family, comprising Rathod’s wife, children and other relatives, occupy the house – located near a statue of Babasaheb Ambedkar – as tenants. The redevelopment of the Ashram, set up by Mahatma Gandhi on the banks of the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad, is being implemented jointly by the Central and state governments, under the Mahatma Gandhi Sabarmati Ashram Memorial Trust. Its masterplan was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March 2024, and the state government hopes to finish the project by 2027. Three properties located on the Ashram premises – A, B and C – however, have been in litigation before the Small Causes Court in Ahmedabad. Property B comprises the residential area where the Rathods are now the lone residents, while Properties A and C are plots of land measuring together 6,000 sq yards. The Rathods claim that all the three properties were handed over to their ancestors by a trustee of the Ashram, sometime in 1930. The Rathods sought an order to restrain the trust from dispossessing them of the three properties, and applied for an injunction order in 2014, while claiming tenancy rights. In 2019, the Small Causes Court granted injunction for Property B, but did not give any relief for Properties A and C. An appellate court upheld the order, after which the Rathods moved a revision application before the Gujarat High Court, which too did not give them any relief in June 2025. Sources said the family has not challenged this order yet, even as they continue to occupy the house. To facilitate the Ashram redevelopment, one of the first steps taken by the BJP government was offering alternative accommodation or monetary compensation to people living on the premises, so that the properties owned by various trusts connected with the Ashram could be vacated. Officials said this part was “the most sensitive” aspect of the project, with the stress being on avoiding controversy. Most of the occupants – known as “Ashramwasis” – claimed a long association with the Ashram, with their forefathers having moved in along with Mahatma Gandhi in the early 1900s. A top official said: “People had to be convinced to vacate their properties, and the compensation package had to be negotiated.” Official sources said that of the 256 families which accepted resettlement and have moved out include 43 which opted for four-BHK flats, 16 for homes in a government-built society, and 24 for a cooperative and housing society near the Ashram. Besides the above, 173 accepted monetary compensation, amounting to between Rs 60 lakh and Rs 90 lakh, depending on the units they occupied. “Only one residential building remains to be vacated,” an official said, referring to the Rathods’ case in court. Rathod’s son Krunal refused to talk about the legal issue, while other family members did not entertain any queries on it. Sources connected with the project said they were confident of winning the case. “We are committed to giving everyone a fair compensation for eviction (including the Rathods) since it has been established that they are tenants. We have moved for expediency of the proceedings in the Small Cases Court so that it does not stall the project.”  Parimal A Dabhi works with The Indian Express as Chief of Bureau, focusing on the state of Gujarat.

But how do bowlers effect dismissals in this insane-scoring era, where batters possess the ability to hit any ball to the boundary? The Indian Express looked at the top four wicket-takers in T20I format since the 2024 T20 World Cup till January 29 2025. The length which yielded the most wickets and has the best economy rate among all of the lengths has been good length deliveries. Wickets taken: 56| Wickets from good length: 26|Economy: 6.8 Most productive deliveries: Googly (43 wickets) and leg break (9 wickets) The Indian spinner, the No.1-ranked T20I bowler, is the top wicket-taker in this cycle. Varun’s ability to consistently bowl on the good length, varying his speed and mixing his leg-spinners and googlies makes it a daunting task for the batters to pick him. His precision and control mean he can operate in difficult phases of the game. Total wickets taken: 47| Wickets from good length: 20|Economy: 6.6 Most Productive deliveries: in swingers (15 wickets) and out swingers (13 wickets) He is the lone pacer in a list dominated by wrist spinners and also the only fast bowler in the top four (4th) in the ICC rankings. Duffy can swing the ball both ways and has become the spearhead of the Kiwi attack in the post-Trent Boult-Tim Southee era. Good with the new ball, he is also a death bowling specialist, delivering slower ones and toe-crushing yorkers. Total wickets taken: 41| Wickets from good length: 20|Economy: 5.5 Most productive deliveries: googly (21 wickets) and leg break (17 wickets) The leg-spinner, with his ability to execute the variations accurately and with a quick action, is hard to pick for the batters. Sri Lanka, similar to Chakarvarthy for India, have often deployed him in the tougher powerplay overs or in the final phase of the innings when batters are on a hitting spree. Total wickets taken: 38| Wickets from good length: 29|Economy: 6.6 Most productive delivery: Googly (19 wickets) and carrom ball (15 wickets) The Harry Potter look-alike mystery spinner from Pakistan does weave a bit of magic with his fingers to bamboozle the batters. His overs through the middle have proved to be a headache for the batters to score off, as the Australian batters who have faced him recently found out. Pakistan’s games are in Sri Lanka where the spinners do have a bit of say, plays into his hands. Note: While Duffy (11 wickets), Hasaranga (13 wickets), and Abrar (6 wickets) have their next best lengths as the fuller ones, Chakarvarthy (24 wickets), interestingly, has shorter length as his next most wicket-producing length.

    "full_text": "“I shudder at the thought of what she would have experienced today,” said screenwriter and director Saeed Mirza at the panel titled The Life and Times of Saeed Mirza held at the India Habitat Centre on Tuesday. Mirza, who won a National Film Award for Best Direction for the 1995 film Naseem, was speaking of the freedom his mother once had, small decencies he thinks she might not have received in today’s times. But he is optimistic. “You do see signs of people standing up and sticking their legs out here and there, once in a while. But it takes a little time. The only consideration is how long can the hate last? Love has to follow,” he said, as the audience broke into applause. Organised by Tuli Research Centre for India Studies as part of the 7th Self-Discovery Via Rediscovering India Festival, Mirza was joined by film makers Dibakar Banerjee and Gurvinder Singh. Moderated by Aakash Joshi, Deputy Associate Editor at the Indian Express, the discussion flowed from the craft and politics of filmmaking to funding and freedom. Mirza, whose films include Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai (1980), Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho! (1986) Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro (1989), traced his journey from a “very strong left position” in his early years to a more introspective phase later on. He recalled making his first documentary just before the Emergency was declared. “I thought I was doing something,” he said. Over the years, that certainty changed. After the Babri Masjid demolition, he felt both he and the country were at a “critical juncture” in defining identity. “How does a nation gain its identity, through the destruction of a masjid or the building of a temple? I don’t understand,” he said. Known for films like Khosla Ka Ghosla (2006), Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! (2008), Love Sex Aur Dhokha (2010) and Shanghai (2012), for Banerjee, the question of whether a filmmaker responds to the times is almost irrelevant. “I don’t know how one can make anything without responding to the times that one is a prisoner of,” he said. He described the current moment as one shaped by what he called “stage four capitalism,” where profit enters every space, even the air one breathes. The problem, he argued, is not that popular cinema exists, but that the space for films that “provoke and question and engage rather than entertain” is shrinking. “That is missing. That, I think, is the main differentiator,” he said, comparing the present to the early 2000s when smaller, riskier films still found backing. Singh, whose works include Punjabi movies like Anhey Ghore Da Daan (2011) and Chauthi Koot (2015), spoke of revisiting Mirza’s films from the 1980s before the panel. Watching them back-to-back, he said, felt like witnessing “one long film” that captured a decade of Bombay’s history. “Filmmakers are not just storytellers, they are historians,” he said. Whether or not such films feel immediately relevant, he believes they will endure. “One day the films will resurface… they will be documents of this time.” The discussion also turned to institutions. Singh recalled how film education was once more democratic, drawing students from different classes and regions. While technology has made filmmaking equipment cheaper and more accessible, funding and state support have thinned out. “There is no state support today,” he said, pointing to the absence of meaningful backing for independent films. Mirza agreed that while there was state control earlier, it was “incredibly minimal,” and there was at least a sense of cultural responsibility. Today, he argued, freedom is selective. “You can have as much violence as possible. But if you think of an alternative view of the world that is going to be questioned, that’s the problem,” he said. Yet the conversation was not without hope. Banerjee said optimism lies in younger filmmakers who refuse to seek permission and continue to push boundaries. Singh spoke of building small communities of collaborators outside the industry’s centre, while Mirza returned to the idea that hope comes from people themselves.

    "full_text": "They say sometimes your greatest strength can turn into your biggest threat. For actress Jasmine Dhunna, her beauty and sudden fame allegedly became both. Jasmine made her debut at just 13 in 1979 with Sarkari Mehmaan, opposite Vinod Khanna, who was 33 at the time. The film failed at the box office. Years later, at 18, she appeared in Divorce — but that too could not make an impact. With two unsuccessful films behind her, her career seemed uncertain. Then came the boldest decision of her life. In 1988, Jasmine signed the Ramsay Brothers’ horror film Veerana. At a time when horror films were often dismissed as C-grade cinema and no mainstream actresses were willing to associate with them, this was considered a risky move. But the Ramsay Brothers were masters of their genre — and Jasmine took the gamble. She played a stunning, seductive witch — a character that would change her destiny overnight. Made on a modest budget, Veerana turned out to be a massive box office success, particularly in rural circuits. Jasmine’s bold scenes and striking screen presence made her an overnight sensation. She became wildly popular. Author Dhruv Somani, who has extensively researched the Ramsay Brothers and their films, once told Radio Udaan, “We have to give credit to the Ramsays for making her a star overnight. The way they presented her — in a sensual, almost hypnotic avatar — the focus on her eyes, the lighting — it was impactful.” Released on May 6, 1988, Veerana shattered stereotypes about horror films and performed exceptionally well, especially in rural areas. And then, just as suddenly as she rose — she vanished. ALSO READ | ‘Rajpal Yadav’s house was like a langar for strugglers’: Nawazuddin Siddiqui recalls help; composer pledges Rs 1.1 cr to jailed actor Somani added, “After the film released, people in villages would get genuinely scared walking in the dark, especially in areas without street lights. Jasmine became a face of fear.” The mystery deepened because of Jasmine’s sudden disappearance. For many, it only added to the film’s eerie reputation. Some even began calling Veerana “cursed.” Veerana was said to have been inspired by that eerie encounter — a detail that only intensified rumours around Jasmine’s fate. Her disappearance sparked endless speculation. Some claimed she had been kidnapped by the underworld. Others said she had died. The most widely believed version, however, was that she quietly fled the country at the peak of her fame. Her Veerana co-star Hemant Birje later dismissed the rumours of her death. Speaking to Bollywood Thikana, he said, “I often speak to her. She is very much alive and doing well. She is the only child of her parents. She debuted with Vinod Khanna in Sarkari Mehmaan. Veerana shot her to fame and then suddenly she disappeared. I had dialled her some time ago — she checked on me and said she would call later. She did call me the next day and said, ‘Hey, I have shopped a lot of clothes for you.’ But I could never meet her. She resides in America but keeps travelling to Mumbai. Here, she lives in Versova. However, she never discusses the film. Even today, whenever I go for shows, people approach me to ask about her.” Tabassum Talkies, the YouTube channel once run by late actress Tabassum, offered another perspective: “She signed multiple films after Veerana, but destiny had something else planned. Her beauty became her enemy. The underworld was allegedly after her. They began threatening her. Eventually, she feared for her life and left her career at its peak to settle in the USA.” One persistent rumour suggested that Dawood Ibrahim had approached her, forcing her into hiding. Other claims said she returned to India after her mother’s passing and now lives alone. Yet another theory suggested she went into depression after losing her mother and chose to distance herself from the public eye. At one point, reports even surfaced that the Ramsay Brothers were planning Veerana 2, marking Jasmine’s comeback. But none of these claims were ever officially confirmed by Jasmine or anyone closely associated with her. And before the film could go on floors, the Ramsay Brothers passed away. Was it fear? Was it pressure? Was it personal loss? Or was it simply a woman choosing privacy over fame? Decades later, Jasmine Dhunna remains one of Bollywood’s most haunting mysteries — a star who rose like a flame and vanished into the shadows just as quickly.

    "full_text": "Veteran Afghanistan all-rounder Mohammad Nabi has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during the T20 World Cup 2026 Group D match against South Africa in Ahmedabad on Wednesday. In a statement released on Thursday, the ICC confirmed that Nabi was found to have violated Article 2.4, which relates to “Disobeying an Umpire’s instruction during an International Match.” The incident occurred at the start of the 14th over of Afghanistan’s innings, when Nabi engaged in a prolonged argument with the umpires regarding South African bowler Lungi Ngidi’s wrist band. In addition to the fine, one demerit point has been added to Nabi’s disciplinary record. It is his first offence within a 24-month period. According to the ICC, Nabi admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by David Gilbert of the ICC International Panel of Match Referees, meaning a formal hearing was not required. The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Jayaraman Madanagopal and Sharfuddoula Ibne Shahid, third umpire Nitin Menon, and fourth umpire K.N. Ananthapadmanabhan. Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points. South Africa defeated Afghanistan in arguably one of the greatest T20 World Cup matches, which saw the two sides playing two sets of Super Overs after both the 20-over match and the first Super Over ended up in a tie.

    "full_text": "The Bombay High Court pulled up the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday for failing to take action against encroachers of a road near a school in Powai and asked whether the civic body was powerless. The court directed the highest officer of the municipal ward concerned, along with the most senior officer of the local police station, to remain present during the next hearing on Friday. A bench of Justices Ravindra V Ghuge and Abhay J Mantri was hearing a plea filed by Kalyani Patnaik, principal of Beaumont HFSI Pre-Primary School at Hiranandani Gardens, claiming that the BMC ignored complaints against unauthorised slum-dwellers who had encroached on the road connecting the school with Jogeshwari Vikhroli Link Road (JVLR). She also claimed that the civic body helped the slum-dwellers by providing them with toilets and tanker water supply. On Wednesday, the bench orally remarked that residents, including the BMC commissioner, might be forced to use bicycles or even horses for travel in the future because of road encroachments. Advocate Dhruti Kapadia, appearing for BMC, said on Thursday that the civic body would remove the encroachments and asked for a court order for additional police protection to take action. Kapadia also said the deputy municipal commissioner would file an affidavit with a time-bound plan to remove the encroachments expeditiously. “Is this how you guard the property? Anybody can come and put a hutment and start staying on the main road… Why don’t you tell us that you don’t have the will, desire, means, and courage to remove encroachment on the roads? So, we will at least record that so that Mumbai can be surrendered to encroachers. Should we say you are powerless? You are surrendering Mumbai to all these encroachers,” Justice Ghuge said. The bench said that BMC officials should also remove a mobile toilet parked in the area for a long time.\n“We will blast them (officers) if they tell us lies, and we will direct their demotion. We will transfer them somewhere to a place where they will not get water… This (encroachment) is your (BMC’s) creation and appeasement. By this, you are encouraging encroachers,” the judge remarked. ‘This is like that Tom and Jerry show’ After the BMC counsel said the encroachers were earlier removed from another area (Jai Bheem Nagar) after court orders. “Before we really get angry with the corporation, we will put it in a lighter way. This is like that Tom and Jerry show. You remove somebody from here, Jerry runs there,” the judge remarked. The court further said it had perused last year’s orders, including those refusing to stay the demolition of slums of Jai Bheem Nagar in Powai, adding that it would have to pass stricter orders in the present matter. Justice Ghuge went on to remark, “We are more concerned about the hurt to the civilian people who are residents of Mumbai, who now cannot drive their cars on the road. Everywhere there is a jam… Every day in the evening, we have to wait there at one small patch on P D’Mello Road (in South Mumbai) for almost 30-45 minutes. Cars move like snails and a person can walk faster. Three-lane roads have shrunk to two lanes and so on…” “We are all humans, and we have a limited stay on this earth and not immortals… The date of exit is also marked. In that duration, you have to struggle and endure to keep the city in such a good condition that your next generation will feel they have inherited something good. But your next generation is going to say that our earlier generation was callous and careless and they gave us encroachment,” the judge said.

    "full_text": "Karan Johar is as well known for his flamboyant sense of style as he is for his films. Beyond his work behind the camera, the filmmaker is a familiar on-screen presence, hosting talk shows, making frequent appearances, and showcasing a distinct fashion identity. What many may not know is that while he assisted Aditya Chopra on Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, he also worked as a costume assistant on the film. In a recent conversation with The Hollywood Reporter India, Johar looked back at those days, sharing anecdotes about his first interaction with Shah Rukh Khan and some memorable costume mishaps on the sets of DDLJ. Johar recalled one of his earliest interactions with Shah Rukh Khan. “When I was an AD, my first interaction with Shah Rukh Khan was about the fit of his jeans. He used to wear Wrangler jeans and I asked if I could give him Levi’s instead. When he asked why, I said they would fit him better and give him a sharper silhouette. He paused, went to Adi and asked, ‘Who is this and what is he saying?’” Johar said, laughing. Talking about his DDLJ days, Johar remembered a last-minute costume problem during the iconic song Mehendi Laga Ke Rakhna. There wasn’t enough red fabric for scarves for all the dancers. “I told Saroj Khan ji’s assistant that it would look stylish if the dancers kept one hand in their pocket and held the scarf in the other. I said it would look cool and different. Otherwise, using both hands would look like Yamma Yamma song,” he recalled. But when choreographer Saroj Khan saw the step, she immediately questioned why one hand wasn’t being used. “She caught hold of me, pushed me and said, ‘Go wherever you have to — Goregaon, anywhere — and get the red cloth. Otherwise, I won’t shoot.’” Johar remembered rushing to Goregaon with the costume team, searching for fabric to fix the situation. Another styling choice that didn’t go down well with Saroj Khan was Johar’s decision to dress Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in dungarees for Tujhe Dekha To Yeh Jaana Sanam. “I remember in Tujhe Dekha to Ye Jaana sanam, there was a montage shot where I gave both Shah Rukh and Kajol dungarees. So, Saroj Khan came and she was like ‘ye baba, baby banke kyun aaye hain (why are they dressed like little kids)’ and I was like they are very in. She looked at me horrified. She was like ye kyun baat karta rehta hai (why does he even talk),” Johar said. Johar also spoke about his close collaborator and friend, stylist Anaita Shroff Adajania, revealing how their creative partnership works. “Whenever Anaita works on a film, as she is a dear friend she has access to my wardrobe. For Call Me Bae, she came over and picked out clothes. What she does is genius. You will not notice Ananya Panday wearing my clothes, you will be like they are different measurements,” he said. Johar also admitted he has had his share of regrets when it comes to luxury purchases. “All the watches I bought in the 2000s… I regret buying all of those. I don’t wear watches. I spent a lot of money and gave them away because I don’t wear watches. I regret all that,” he said. He also shared that he once invested in paintings by an artist who is now in jail. “And then there was an artist’s painting that I spent a lot of money buying. He is in jail now. At one point I bought five of his pieces and now he is in jail, so they have no value. So I regret that as well,” he said.

Joining Humpy in Norway Chess Women are reigning women’s world champion Ju Wenjun, reigning champion of Norway Chess Women Anna Muzychuk, and the reigning Women’s World Blitz Champion Bibisara Assaubayeva. The final female player to compete at Norway Chess Women will be revealed soon. “I’m really happy to be part of Norway Chess Women. It’s a tournament I’ve always enjoyed, not only because of the high level of competition but also the warm atmosphere and excellent organization. I’m looking forward to playing in Oslo and competing against some of the world’s strongest players,” Humpy was quoted as saying in the release by Norway Chess announcing her participation.  Humpy will be one of the eight contenders to compete at the Women’s Candidates today.  Humpy is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished female players of her generation. She made history in 2002 when, at just 15 years old, she became the first Indian woman to earn the Grandmaster title,  and at the time, the youngest female grandmaster in history. Her rise continued in 2007 when she became only the second woman ever to cross the 2600 Elo rating mark, a milestone that underlined her place among the world’s elite. In recent years, Humpy has remained firmly in the global spotlight. She is a two-time Women’s World Rapid Champion (2019, 2024), and in 2025 she finished runner-up at the FIDE Women’s World Cup, securing qualification for the 2026 Women’s Candidates Tournament and keeping her ambitions for the world title very much alive. “Humpy has been at the very top for a long time, and that says a lot. Very few players manage to stay at that level while still pushing for the biggest titles year after year. She adds real strength to the field, and we’re very happy to welcome her back to Norway Chess Women,” Benedicte Westre Skog, COO of Norway Chess, said. The Norway Chess Women tournament, launched in 2024, is the world’s first fully equal super tournament for women in chess, staged in parallel with the main Norway Chess event. The tournament features the same format, number of players, playing conditions and prize fund as the open event, setting a new benchmark for gender equality in professional chess. This year, Norway Chess features five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen, Germany’s number one Vincent Keymer, Alireza Firouzja besides the Indian duo of Gukesh and Pragg. Norway Chess is one of the world’s premier chess tournaments, bringing together the top male and female players in a distinctive 6-player double round-robin format. The introduction of Norway Chess Women in 2024, with equal prize funds for men and women, underscores the event’s commitment to gender equality and innovation in the sport. Norway Chess 2026 will take place from May 25 to 5 June at Deichman Bjørvika in Oslo.",
