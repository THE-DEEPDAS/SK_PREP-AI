    "full_text": "For national-level cyclist Surya Thathu, simplicity is key when it comes to race-day nutrition. An ideal pre-race meal, he says, is dal and rice. Part of the Pune Grand Tour’s Indian national team, Thathu told The Indian Express that a pre-race meal should ideally be consumed two to three hours before the start, depending on how quickly an individual’s gut digests food. Even as the historic race is underway, Thathu spoke about nutrition strategies before, during and after competition. “While there is no universal pre-race meal that works for everyone, dal and rice suit most Indians. These are familiar, easy to digest and provide sustained energy,” he said. Globally, riders consume pasta, bread, rice cakes, yogurt or muesli before races. “For longer races, protein is also included in breakfast. Portion sizes are adjusted according to body type, capacity and gut tolerance. Riders must train their gut—trying to consume too many carbs suddenly (for example, 100 grams per hour) can cause bloating, nausea, or vomiting,” Thathu explained. Carl Jolly of the UK-based Schils Doltcini team echoed similar views, stressing the importance of the night-before meal. “Loads and loads of carbohydrates. We think that the dinner the night before the race is the most important. So a huge pile of rice, and some vegetables and some fruits as well to get some vitamins and minerals with as much carbohydrates as possible,” he said. “Rice is really good because it is easy to digest. During the race we don’t use solid food. We have carbohydrate powders, in bottles or in packs. So we try to have maybe 100–110 gm of carbohydrates per hour during the race,” Jolly added. On protein intake, he observed, “I think that’s more important for training than the actual race. Protein is not going to make much of a difference (during the race).” At the WorldTour level, riders aim for up to 120 grams of carbohydrates per hour, depending on race intensity and conditions. In India, cyclists typically consume 70–100 grams per hour, as gut adaptation and access to specialised nutrition products can be challenging. Faced with issues of availability and affordability, Thathu began experimenting with home-based alternatives. “I prefer homemade energy bars made from oats, honey, muesli and dry fruits. These can be carried in the back pockets of a jersey or kept in a support car or bag during training,” he said. “I personally prefer them to gels and that works for me,” he added, noting that his mother now prepares them. Hydration, Thathu stressed, is equally critical. Cyclists rarely consume plain water during races, opting instead for carbohydrate-electrolyte mixes or electrolytes alone. “On average, 600 ml per hour is a good target, though this depends on weather, race duration and individual needs,” he said. Supplements such as multivitamins, fish oil and magnesium may help with recovery and sleep quality, but should be taken only based on individual requirements. “Blood tests and guidance from a nutritionist are essential,” Thathu said. Post-race recovery, he added, should prioritise carbohydrates and protein. “Foods like bananas, protein shakes with oats or banana smoothies help replenish energy and support muscle repair. This should be followed by stretching, core work, a bath and finally a proper meal—dal, roti and sabzi remain a solid and balanced choice for recovery.”\n‘Race day should be the most predictable day’ Sports physiotherapist Dr Anand Gangwal said endurance athletes often undermine months of preparation by making last-minute nutritional changes. “In a four-day staged event like the Pune Grand Tour, such mistakes can compound with each passing day,” he said. “From my experience of competing in multiple Ironman events and marathons, one principle has consistently held true—nothing new on race day. This applies not only to pacing and equipment but equally to food, fluids and even caffeine use. The gut and the nervous system respond best to what they have already been trained to tolerate,” Dr Gangwal added. “The objective is to begin each stage with full energy stores and a settled stomach. During the race, carbohydrates should be consumed at regular intervals, often every 15–20 minutes, using gels, sports drinks or simple foods that have been repeatedly tested in training. Hydration should be planned rather than reactive. Both dehydration and over-drinking can impair performance, particularly in Pune’s warm conditions,” he said. Caffeine, Dr Gangwal cautioned, requires careful management in stage racing. “While it can reduce perceived effort and help sustain power, the sudden increase of caffeine intake on race day may elevate heart rate, disrupt pacing, trigger gastrointestinal symptoms and interfere with sleep—all of which affect performance across subsequent stages.” “The safest approach is to use only the amount and timing already practised in training. Many experienced athletes taper caffeine intake four to five days before the event, allowing lower doses to be effective during the race without overstimulation,” he said. He also warned against attempting weight loss close to competition. “Performance depends on sustainable power and not short-term reductions on the scale. Eventually in a multi-day race, consistency is the true advantage. Athletes who trust their rehearsed routine and resist the temptation to experiment give themselves the best chance of performing well, day after day.” (With inputs by Soham Shah)  Anuradha Mascarenhas is a Senior Editor at The Indian Express, based in Pune.

    "full_text": "Researchers from the University of Cambridge and Beihang University have developed a unique AI-powered wearable that could prove a boon to patients who survived a stroke.  The device, which is a choker, can help people in recovering their speech without the need for any invasive brain implant. Dubbed as an ‘intelligent throat’ device named Revoice, it allows patients with dysarthria to communicate by silently mouthing words. Reportedly, the device decodes words and picks up emotional cues based on pulse patterns. It can expand based on fragmentary thoughts to form complete expressions.  The device has the potential to transform the lives of those suffering from dysarthria – a motor-speech disorder that usually is an outcome of a stroke. This condition also compromises neuromuscular control over the vocal tract. Because of this condition, stroke patients often find it challenging to form words even when they know what they want to communicate.  “This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems,” the researchers write in Nature Communications. The researchers tested the device on five stroke patients with the help of a 47-word vocabulary of common phrases. In this test, the system was able to decode 95.8 per cent of words and 97.1 per cent of complete sentences. The system also tagged speech with emotional cues to make communication feel natural. About 55 per cent of users expressed higher satisfaction compared to basic word-by-word output.  Revoice senses subtle vibrations in the throat and pulse at the carotid artery. When a user silently mouths the words, the sensors printed on the soft and flexible fabric band record the tiny movements. Following this, a small circuit transmits data to AI that interprets speech and emotional cues. The signals from the device are reportedly processed by two AI agents; while one reconstructs words from bits of silently mouthed speech, the other interprets emotional state and contextual information.  While earlier devices pushed users to take pauses between words, Revoice analysed speech continuously in rapid 100-millisecond segments, leading to an experience that is much closer to natural conversation. According to the makers, the fabric sensors are highly sensitive and are able to respond to deformations as tiny as 0.1 per cent. The device has been built to be worn all day and is powered by a battery that can last a full day.  Testing of the device showed high accuracy for stroke survivors. Initially, the team taught the system patterns from 10 healthy volunteers and later fine-tuned it for each patient. The study found that the performance hiked significantly around 25 repetitions per word, demonstrating that the system could adapt faster to individual speech patterns impacted by stroke.  The results of the research, published in Nature Communications, can be beneficial to support people even with conditions such as Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease. Reportedly the researchers are currently planning a clinical study in Cambridge for native English-speaking dysarthria patients to study the viability of the system.  It needs to be noted that the research is at an early, experimental stage, with very limited testing and no broad clinical deployment. The test was with only five patients, and the device still needs much more clinical study before it could be widely available.    Bangladesh's sports advisor, Asif Nazrul, stands firm on the decision to not send their national team to India for the T20 World Cup, despite the ICC's ultimatum.

    "full_text": "The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition seeking the eviction of a former MLA from a government house in Chandigarh Sector 5, holding that statutory proceedings for eviction were already pending and that the issue could be raised in a connected matter. During a hearing before a division bench of Chief Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Sanjiv Berry, the petitioner contended that the former MLA was enjoying “extraordinary relief” by continuing to occupy a prime government residence despite having ceased to hold public office. It was argued that the allotment flowed from a Supreme Court order but that subsequent directions in public interest required former MPs and MLAs to vacate government accommodation. According to the petitioner, an eviction order had been passed nearly five years ago, yet the occupant had not vacated and had even resisted attempts by the administration to take possession of the house. The petitioner was represented by senior advocate R S Bains, while the Union Territory administration was represented by senior counsel Amit Jhanji. Bains submitted that such conduct amounted to lawlessness and sent a wrong signal if tolerated in a planned city like Chandigarh. He stressed that the case involved a politician defying the law for years and warranted urgent judicial intervention. Opposing the plea, the Union Territory administration argued that the petition was misconceived and politically motivated. Jhanji submitted that proceedings under the Public Premises Act were already pending against the former MLA and that penal rent was being levied. He said there was no question of selective action, as eviction proceedings were underway in respect of several government houses across different sectors, including Sectors 5, 7, 11, 16, 22, 23, and 27. ‘No occupant is being protected’ The administration further pointed out that detailed particulars of all such properties and the status of proceedings had been placed on record through affidavits, including an order dated January 23, 2023, initiating eviction under Section 5 of the Public Premises Act in respect of House No. 33, Sector 5. It was argued that the law was being followed uniformly and that no occupant was being protected. The bench observed that once proceedings under the statutory framework are already in motion, the court would not entertain a parallel case on the same issue. It also noted that similar questions were pending consideration in the other case. Granting liberty to the petitioner to raise all contentions regarding House No. 33 in the pending PIL, listed for February 20, the bench dismissed the petition as infructuous. An oral request to intervene in the pending matter was declined, with the court observing that a formal application could be filed on that date.

So, what happens when you drink 3 litres of water every day for 30 days? Drinking around three litres of water every day — roughly 100 ounces — can offer real benefits, especially if you live in a hot climate, do strenuous activity, or sweat a lot, said dietician Vidhi Chawla, founder of FISICO Diet and Aesthetic Clinic. With sustained, adequate hydration over a month, many people notice improved skin moisture, perhaps fewer headaches (especially those related to minor dehydration), and easier digestion or more regular bowel movements, since water helps prevent constipation, said Chawla. “Proper hydration also reduces the risk of kidney stones — enough fluid dilutes the urine and helps flush out minerals that might otherwise accumulate,” said Chawla. However, drinking 3 litres a day isn’t a one-size-fits-all prescription, according to Chawla; body weight, activity level and environment matter. “For a relatively sedentary person in a mild climate, 3 litres might already be on the high side. Excessive water — or drinking too much too quickly — carries risks. It can dilute the sodium and other electrolytes in your blood, leading to hyponatremia. When sodium falls too low, cells swell; in the brain, that swelling can cause dangerous pressure, leading to confusion, headaches, muscle cramps, nausea, and in extreme cases, even seizures or loss of consciousness,” described Chawla. You might also find yourself constantly running to the bathroom, especially if you spread your water intake evenly but lose little fluid through sweat or activity. “For people with existing kidney or heart conditions — or those on certain medications — forcing high water intake without medical advice can add stress to organs trying to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance,” said Chawla. Therefore, 3 litres per day over 30 days could help you feel more energetic, support your digestion and kidney health, and perhaps benefit your skin and mood — if your body truly needs that much water (due to workouts, heat, or heavy sweating). You drink it steadily rather than gulping at once. “But drinking that much water without need — or too quickly — can backfire, causing electrolyte imbalance or overburdening your kidneys. The key is to listen to your body: drink when you’re thirsty, not by rigid volume goals; keep an eye on your urine colour (pale yellow generally indicates good hydration); and adjust based on your activity, climate and health,” said Chawla.

Chongly Thao, a 56-year-old naturalised US citizen, was taking a nap in his home in St. Paul on Sunday afternoon when ICE agents began banging at the door. Thao, who was born in Laos and came to the US at the age of 4, said masked ICE agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, including this daughter-in-law and grandson, yelling at them. “I was shaking,” he said. “They didn’t show any warrant; they just broke down the door,” Thao, who goes by the name Scott, told The Associated Press. Thao, who has been a US citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained, he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification, but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it. Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs, wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbours screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao’s family alone. The Trump administration is disgusting! Yesterday, ICE raided a home on St. Paul’s East Side. Their target was ChongLy Scott Thao, an elderly Hmong American man.He’s a U.S. citizen with no criminal record.Armed ICE agents broke down the door without presenting a valid… pic.twitter.com/cJhysjhq6R Thao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere” and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving. Agents eventually realized that he was a US citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There, they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said. Following the incident, the Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao’s home as a “targeted operation” seeking two convicted sex offenders. “The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets. However, Thao’s family rejected the DHS account and said they “strongly object to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.” Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property’s owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. Thao’s son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin’s boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.",

The Artemis II mission is expected to lift off as early as February 6, with backup launch opportunities later till April. Once launched, the mission will send four astronauts on a roughly 10-day journey around the Moon. This will be the first time humans travel beyond low-Earth orbit and circle the Moon since the final Apollo mission in 1972. The crew includes Nasa astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, along with Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen. Together, they will travel aboard the Orion spacecraft, which will loop around the Moon before returning to Earth. The mission is designed to test systems and procedures needed for future lunar landings. “This historic mission will send humans farther from Earth than ever before and deliver the insights needed for us to return to the Moon,” Nasa administrator Jared Isaacman was quoted as saying by the agency’s website. “It’s a critical step forward for human exploration.” Adding to the excitement, Nasa is giving people around the world a chance to be part of the mission in a symbolic way. The space agency is inviting the public to send their names to the Moon aboard Artemis II. Anyone who registers will have their name stored on an SD card that will fly inside the Orion spacecraft during the mission. Nasa said millions of people have already signed up. “1.5 million names are flying around the Moon on Artemis II. Is yours one of them?” the agency said in a post on X. “It’s not too late to add your name to the mission, and it’s absolutely free.” Those interested can submit their names through Nasa’s “Send Your Name with Artemis” programme until January 21. For those who want to get their name written, the process is quick and easy and takes less than five minutes. People simply need to visit Nasa’s “Send Your Name with Artemis” website, enter their first and last names along with a four- to seven-digit PIN code, and submit the details. Once the process is completed, a customised digital boarding pass can be downloaded as a keepsake for being part of the Artemis II mission.    The drama surrounding the Beckhams has reached new heights as Brooklyn Beckham cuts ties with his parents and enjoys life with his wife and her billionaire parents.

This reaction comes soon after reports that the International Cricket Council (ICC) had given an ultimatum to Bangladesh to decide their participation in the showpiece event by January 21. The T20 World Cup is set to start from February 7 in India and Sri Lanka with Bangladesh scheduled to play their first match on the opening day itself against West Indies in Kolkata’s Eden Gardens. They would play all four league games in India, three in Kolkata and one in Mumbai. “If the ICC bows to pressure from the Indian Cricket Board and tries to impose pressure on us by setting unreasonable conditions, we will not accept those conditions,” he asserted. “There have been examples in the past when India said that they won’t travel to Pakistan to play and ICC has changed the venue. We have asked to change the venue for logical reasons and we cannot be pressured to play in India by putting illogical pressure on us,” he told reporters. The ongoing logjam, an aftermath of strayed diplomatic ties between the two nations, happened after Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman was abruptly released from his IPL contract with the Kolkata Knight Riders following a BCCI diktat. Following that, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said that they will not be sending the national team to India citing security concerns and national pride. However, ICC’s risk assessment report did not flag any specific or direct threat to the team’s participation in the World Cup. The BCB has said that they wanted to play their four group stage matches in Sri Lanka and last week they had even proposed swapping positions with Ireland in Group B in a meeting with representatives of the ICC. Bangladesh are currently in Group C along with the West Indies, Italy, England and Nepal while Ireland’s group consists of co-hosts Sri Lanka, Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe.  The standoff has spilled onto the third week, after the BCB communicated their concerns first on January 4. The tournament is now less than three weeks away.

    "full_text": "Long before Bengaluru stirred awake on Tuesday, an unusual crowd had already gathered outside the Karnataka Silk Industries Corporation (KSIC) showroom. According to a viral post, around 4 am, people began lining up quietly, and by the time the sun rose, the queue had grown into a long, winding line. Families waited together, elderly women held on to their handbags, and younger shoppers spent time on their phones, all hoping to buy an authentic Mysore silk saree. Mysore silk sarees, known for their rich texture and fine craftsmanship, are priced anywhere between Rs 23,000 and Rs 2.5 lakh. A video showing the early-morning rush outside the KSIC outlet has since gone viral on social media, drawing widespread attention. With demand surging, KSIC has introduced stricter measures to manage the crowds. As reported by Kannada Prabha, the showroom is now operating with a token system. Only those with tokens are allowed inside, and each customer can buy just one saree. A post on X shared visuals of the long queue, showing people waiting patiently outside the store. Some sat on plastic chairs, while others stood in line for hours. The caption explained, “There is an ongoing shortage (or more precisely, a supply shortfall) of authentic Mysore silk sarees, particularly those produced by the Karnataka Silk Industries Corporation, which holds the official production and GI-tagged rights for pure Mysore silk sarees.” It further added, “This has been a consistent issue throughout 2025, with no clear indication of resolution into 2026. First up, the Corporation has a limited number of skilled in-house weavers and artisans. Their training takes 6-7 months for even basic proficiency. Production is restricted to the Corporation’s trained workforce and facilities, preventing rapid scaling. Seasonal peaks (weddings, Varalakshmi Puja, Gowri Ganesha, Deepavali) worsen the crunch, with showrooms often selling out quickly.” Women queue up from 4.00 AM outside a Karnataka Soviet (sorry Silk) Industries Corporation showroom to buy silk sarees starting from ₹23,000 and going up to ₹250,000.

One user pointed out, “Men have all the right to queue up for iphones 12 hrs before the shop opens, but women lining up for saree is much talked about.” Another commented, “The likes of Michael Kors & Gucci’s need to learn lessons from Karnataka Silk Corporation.” Others drew nostalgic parallels, with one user saying, “They are being given 60-70-80’s vibes!! Chalo.. we used to stand in queue for ration, books, stationary etc.. now these people are standing in queue for a saree!!” A fourth user questioned the criticism altogether, writing, “People queue up for PlayStation, they queue up for Iphone, people even queue up at cult restaurants, so whats so weird if they queue up for silk saree?”    The drama surrounding the Beckhams has reached new heights as Brooklyn Beckham cuts ties with his parents and enjoys life with his wife and her billionaire parents.

    "full_text": "Pakistan has extended the ban on Indian airlines and aircraft from entering its airspace by another month—till the early morning of February 24—as per a fresh notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued by Pakistan’s aviation authorities. India is also expected to respond soon and extend the closure of its airspace for Pakistani airlines and aircraft for a similar period, taking the neighbouring countries’ reciprocal airspace closures into their tenth month. The fresh NOTAM issued by Pakistan is similar to the previous ones, except for the effective duration of airspace closure. Islamabad will keep the Pakistani airspace closed to Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated, owned or leased by Indian airlines and operators, including military flights, till 05:29 AM India time on February 24. With the relations between New Delhi and Islamabad worsening after the Pahalgam terror attack in April last year, Pakistan closed its airspace on April 24. Initially for one month, this ban prohibited Indian aircraft and airlines from overflying Pakistan. India responded on April 30 by closing its airspace to Pakistani aircraft and airlines. Since then, both countries have extended airspace closures one month at a time. Although the neighbours have banned each other’s airlines and aircraft, their respective airspaces remain open for overflying by airlines from other countries. Pakistan issued its latest NOTAM extending the airspace closure on Tuesday, a few days before the January 24 expiration of the earlier notice. India’s current ban on Pakistani aircraft is also set to expire on January 24, and Indian aviation authorities are expected to issue a new NOTAM to extend the ban by another month before that. Approximately 800 weekly flights operated by Indian airlines have been affected due to the closure of Pakistan’s airspace. These flights, mostly between North India and destinations in regions like West Asia, the Caucasus, Europe, the UK, and eastern North America, are being forced to take longer routes. This leads to several operational challenges like increased flight durations with journeys extended by anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours depending on the distance and location of the destination, in addition to higher fuel consumption and increased complexity in crew and flight scheduling. Ultimately, these increase the operational costs for the airlines. Tata group airline Air India estimates that the Pakistani airspace closure could cost it around Rs 4,000 crore on an annualised basis, it is learnt. In contrast, the impact of India’s airspace closure has been rather insignificant on Pakistan as Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), the country’s flag carrier, has a limited international presence and is currently struggling, unlike India’s rapidly expanding aviation sector and airlines. According to data from aviation analytics company Cirium, only about six PIA flights per week—those traveling between Kuala Lumpur and Lahore or Islamabad—routinely flew over India before these airspace closures took effect in April. For Indian airlines, the situation is quite different. All major Indian carriers operate international flights to countries west of India, and many of these previously overflew Pakistan, even though none of them have flights to destinations in Pakistan. Air India serves destinations across West Asia, Europe, the UK, and North America. IndiGo flies to West Asia, Turkey, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, and Europe. With the closure of the Pakistani airspace, IndiGo was forced to suspend flights from Delhi to the Central Asian cities of Almaty and Tashkent because these routes were beyond the operational range of its narrow-body aircraft fleet. Air India Express, Akasa Air, and SpiceJet also operate international flights, primarily to West Asia. The financial implications for Indian airlines are substantial. When Pakistan previously closed its airspace for over four months in 2019, Indian carriers collectively incurred estimated losses of around Rs 700 crore. These costs were primarily due to increased fuel expenses and operational difficulties resulting from the longer routes they were forced to take. Air India was the most severely affected Indian carrier at that time, as it operated more west-bound international flights and was, and remains, the sole Indian airline with ultra-long-haul services to North America. But in recent years, other Indian airlines, particularly IndiGo, have also expanded their international networks, utilising their existing fleets of narrow-body jets to serve various destinations. Notably, IndiGo is the only Indian airline that operates flights to Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Turkey.

The independent regulator on Monday, January 19, indicated that the Facebook and Instagram parent was happy to continue taking money from criminals. Tim Miller, the Commission’s executive director, said that anyone who ‍has ⁠spent even a little time on Meta’s platforms would more than likely have seen ads in their feed for illegal online casinos. Many of the ads were for sites that did ​not participate in Britain’s ‘GamStop’ self-exclusion scheme for online ‌gambling, as per Miller. Meta’s assertion that it did not know about such ads until it was notified is “simply false”. “It could leave you with the impression they are quite happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking money from criminals and scammers until someone ‌shouts about it,” he was quoted as saying by Reuters. In his speech, Miller further said that Meta’s searchable ad library showed which ‌advertisers said their sites were “Not on GamStop”. “If we can find them then so can ‌Meta. They simply choose not to look,” he said. In response, Meta said it enforced strict advertising policies regarding online gambling ‌ and gaming ads, and any ads that violated these policies were promptly removed once identified. “We’ve been ‌working closely with the Commission to identify and remove all the flagged ads found in violation of ‌our policies, and we’re ‍using this ⁠intelligence to ​further improve the proactive detection tools we already have in place,” a spokesperson was quoted as saying. “We would encourage ⁠the Commission to continue to collaborate with ⁠us to ensure users and legitimate advertisers are protected from these bad actors,” they added. While sports betting and online gambling is legal in the UK, operators must adhere to stringent regulations set forth by the Gambling Commission to offer gambling products and services. As for India, the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, prohibits all forms of online money games such as poker and fantasy sports, while only allowing “online social games” and e-sports. In October last year, the IT Ministry released draft rules for online gaming under which it proposes to set up the Online Gaming Authority of India as a regulator, draw up the process of obtaining registration for companies to legally operate in India and form a three-tiered grievance redressal system, among other things. However, the Supreme Court is currently hearing a constitutional challenge to the online real-money gaming ban with the main petitioner, Head Digital Works Pvt Ltd, questioning the Parliament’s power to impose a complete ban on real-money games.    The drama surrounding the Beckhams has reached new heights as Brooklyn Beckham cuts ties with his parents and enjoys life with his wife and her billionaire parents.

Continued outflows from foreign investors also contributed to the slide. The 30-share BSE Sensex tanked 1.28 per cent, or 1,065.71 points, to settle at 82,180.47. The broader Nifty50 crashed 1.38 per cent, or 353 points to close at 25,232.5. Both indices posted their steepest single-day fall in eight months. In the last two trading sessions, the Sensex has shed 1.66 per cent, while the Nifty has fallen 1.8 per cent amid heavy selling pressure due to elevated geopolitical tensions. The market capitalisation, or the total value of all listed shares, of the BSE-listed firms declined by Rs 9.86 lakh crore to Rs 455.82 lakh crore. “Markets extended their weakness on Tuesday and ended lower amid broad-based selling and weak global cues,” said Ajit Mishra, senior VP (Research) Religare Broking Ltd. Last week, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 10 per cent tariffs on eight European countries — including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland — that have opposed his plan to acquire Greenland, effective February 1. The levy will increase to 25 per cent on June 1. The announcement has revived uncertainty around global trade, market participants said. Domestic markets remained cautious ahead of the US Supreme Court’s ruling on Trump-era tariffs, with renewed uncertainty over US trade policy prolonging the recent consolidation. “Continued FPI outflows, rising US and Japanese bond yields, and a weakening rupee weighed on investor confidence,” said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Investments Ltd. Market sentiment also remained subdued due to mixed corporate earnings. Selling was widespread, with realty, auto and IT stocks among the key laggards, while banking stocks offered limited support. The broader market witnessed sharp pressure, with both midcap and smallcap indices declining by over 2.5 per cent, reflecting heightened risk aversion and a lack of conviction across segments. Nifty Bank declined 0.81 per cent. Nifty sectoral indices took a beating, with Nifty Realty leading the loss at 5 per cent. Nifty Auto followed with a 2.48 per cent slide, Nifty IT declined 2.06 per cent, and Nifty Pharma dropped 1.91 per cent. India VIX jumped 7.63 per cent to close at 12.73, indicating heightened market uncertainty. The NSE companies that declined the most included Adani Enterprises (3.96 per cent), Bajaj Finance (3.89 per cent), Jio Financial Services (3.72 per cent), Eternal Ltd (3.59 per cent) and Coal India Ltd 3.29 per cent). In the near term, market sentiment will hinge on the earnings season, while geopolitical developments and global trade conditions remain important influences.    The drama surrounding the Beckhams has reached new heights as Brooklyn Beckham cuts ties with his parents and enjoys life with his wife and her billionaire parents.

The Delhi Police have recognised three primary accounts used to move the defrauded amount, and arrests have also been made.  These cases are part of a larger trend of cybercrimes in the country. In 2024, India reportedly incurred a loss of 22,842 crore to fraudulent cyber schemes from registered complaints of 1,23,672. It accounted for a 206 per cent increase from 7,465.18 crores in 2023 and over 2,306 crores in  2022.  Cybercrimes like Digital arrest involve scammers impersonating law enforcement officials from agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) or police through video calls and falsely accusing victims of involvement in grave crimes such as drug trafficking, money laundering or terrorism.  By claiming that their Aadhaar, bank account, or courier parcels are linked to the crime, victims are placed under fictitious “digital custody” through prolonged video calls lasting hours or even days. They are forced into transferring large sums under threat of arrest, asset seizure, legal prosecution or public shaming. These scams imitate bureaucratic practices, badges, “case numbers”, fake warrants, spoofed official numbers, and deepfake videos to scam professionals, retirees, students and even MPs. Notably, “digital arrest” has not been explicitly defined in any law. Although fraudulent online activities are addressed under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and organised criminal activity under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, neither law explicitly defines “cybercrimes”, causing ambiguity in the enforcement of regulatory response. As per Section 63 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) 2023, summons may be served electronically, but only if the communication is encrypted and carries the court’s seal, image, and authorised digital signature. While such digitisation streamlines procedural delivery, the BNSS retains a clear emphasis on embodied due process that all forms of arrest require physical custody, the arresting officer must display proper identification, and an arrest memo must be prepared contemporaneously.  As per section 35(3), only when the conditions for compulsory arrest under Section 35(1) don’t materialise, the police could follow traditional procedures and issue a notice asking the individual suspected of a cognizable offence to appear for questioning.  However, India’s legal system equips enforcement agencies with multiple implicit avenues to tackle ‘digital arrest’ scams. The IT Act, 2000 (with later amendments) criminalises unauthorised access, identity theft, and other forms of online fraud. There are provisions in the BNS on cheating, intimidation, extortion, impersonation, and criminal conspiracy that can be applied in conjunction with the relevant sections of the IT Act in such cases.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 further seeks to strengthen data privacy by including the aspects of consent and data minimisation. It mandates an individual’s consent before processing their personal data, and requires entities to collect and retain the amount of data necessary for legitimate use. Such provisions make the misuse or leaking of personal data a clear violation, even though the Act’s ‘enforcement architecture’ is still being built.  Concurrently, India has also developed a multi-layered cyber-fraud response system. The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), dedicated state cyber police stations, the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, the 1930 fraud helpline, and the Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System can collectively create a national cyber-fraud response grid capable of rapidly flagging transactions and freezing funds.  Hence, it may be argued that the persistence of digital arrest scams does not emanate from a legislative void, but rather from gaps in capacity, coordination, and system design. For instance, uneven digital literacy among citizens, varying policing capabilities across states, and fragmented integration between digital platforms and enforcement agencies are among some of the factors that do not stem from the absence of legal provisions on the statute book. Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) has been instituted as an attached office to the Ministry of Home Affairs, so as to coordinate a comprehensive, national response to all cybercrime complaints. With respect to matters of digital arrest complaints, it has blocked over 1,700 Skype IDs, 59,000 WhatsApp accounts, 6.69 lakh SIM cards, and 1,32,000 IMEIs in 2024 alone.  The Central Government and telecom service providers also devised systems to identify and block incoming international spoofed calls displaying Indian mobile numbers. The Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System has saved over ₹3,431 crore from fraudulent attempts.  These efforts are further complemented by public awareness campaigns, including newspaper advertisements, announcements in Delhi Metro, social media influencer campaigns, Prasar Bharti programming, All India Radio broadcasts, and digital displays at railway stations and airports. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also used the “Mann ki Baat” platform to urge people to “Stop, Think, and Act” before responding to suspicious calls that could potentially lead to situations of digital arrest.  Efforts are also underway to move beyond SMS-based OTP authentication for digital payments. The RBI released a draft framework in July 2024, proposing alternative authentication mechanisms, and its Innovation Hub has also developed an AI-powered system – MuleHunter.AI – for analysing transaction patterns, predicting and flagging mule accounts. But the unparalleled pace with which India has advanced its digitisation trajectory has not just eased access to services for millions, but also inadvertently caused what is called “cyber fraud epidemic”. It has apparently undermined public trust in the digital system. Digital arrest scams cause immediate, tangible harm while quietly eroding confidence in India’s digital ecosystem in the long run.  The victims are hit with sudden and often devastating financial losses, driving some households into debt, apart from leaving lasting psychological scars marked by fear, shame, and confusion. Many victims delay or avoid reporting the crime, allowing fraudsters to rapidly launder stolen funds through multiple accounts.  Moreover, these scams also expose a critical deficit in digital literacy, especially in semi-urban and rural areas, underscoring a broader societal unpreparedness for rapid digital transformation. It has reportedly created confusion, particularly among the elderly citizens and less informed public, on what constitutes legitimate communication from the state and how it could be differentiated from forged orders.  The circulation of fabricated judicial orders bearing forged Supreme Court seals prompted the court to remark that digital arrest scam “strikes at the very foundation of public trust in the judicial system, besides the rule of law”.  The Supreme Court asked the RBI to assist the court on whether artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning could be implemented to identify such suspicious accounts and freeze the proceeds of crime. The bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi also noted that the matter of digital arrests “requires immediate attention” of the CBI, adding that the premier investigating agency “shall firstly investigate cases on digital arrests scam.”  Given the role of mule accounts in perpetrating the scam, the court said the CBI shall have a free hand to probe the role of bankers under the Prevention of Corruption Act, where bank accounts are opened for the purpose of digital arrest scams.  The apex court instructed the CBI to seek assistance from Interpol to trace cybercriminals operating from offshore tax havens. It also directed telecom providers to tighten regulatory oversight by curbing the issuance of multiple SIMs without due procedural diligence. This approach has enabled systemic capacity-building, where states are held directly accountable for delays in matters of mandated preservation of seized digital evidence and in fast-tracking the creation of cybercrime coordination centres. While such judicial interventions are timely and signal a decisive shift from reactive policing to systemic deterrence, the eradication of these scams will depend on aligning technological capability, regulatory accountability, and public confidence. Digital arrest scams threaten the trust and reliance of ordinary citizens in digitisation that anchors our e-governance. If handled with adequate gravity, the fight against cybercrime also presents an opportunity to rebuild India’s digital ecosystem on firmer foundations tied to the rule of law. Given the transnational nature of cybercrime, it may be argued that active and efficient global cooperation is required to effectively contain it. The Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (2001) provides the primary international legal framework, establishing mechanisms for mutual assistance, common investigative standards, and the most mature model for harmonising cyber-offence definitions.  The United Nations Convention against Cybercrime, which opened for signature in October 2024 in Hanoi, Vietnam, represents a significant multilateral effort to create unified approaches distinguishing between cyber-enabled crimes (traditional offences conducted online) and cyber-dependent crimes (phishing, identity theft, malware deployment).  Long-standing cooperation channels like INTERPOL and Europol emphasise combined investigative credentials and joint disruption operations, as seen in actions such as Operation Serengeti in Africa and the takedown of LabHost by the UK.    In the UK, ongoing debates around a statutory “cyber duty to protect” extend this principle by recognising that firms and not just users have an enforceable obligation to guard against foreseeable cyber harms. The underlying principle is that institutions with the greatest technical capacity should bear the highest/higher responsibility quotient.  Similarly, the European Union Digital Services Act has established mandatory systems for reporting illegal content, transparency obligations, structured risk assessments, and independent audits for large digital platforms. In high-risk areas like fraudulent advertising, deepfake calls, and scam apps, this approach causes/treats platforms as actors with systemic influence and corresponding accountability.  A parallel development in the European Union’s payment-services reforms shifts liability towards banks and payment intermediaries, requiring them to freeze suspicious transactions and reimburse consumers where preventive systems fail. This points to a shift from user-centric liability to ‘platform and provider responsibility’ approach – a move India may consider to strengthen its digital-fraud resilience. Discuss how “digital arrest” scams undermine due process, public trust in institutions, and the legitimacy of digital governance in India. Evaluate whether India’s existing legal framework (IT Act, BNSS, BNS, DPDP Act) is sufficient to deal with emerging forms of cyber fraud such as “digital arrest”. Suggest reforms. What are “mule accounts”? Why do they pose a serious challenge to India’s cybersecurity ecosystem? Discuss the role of artificial intelligence and real-time financial surveillance systems in combating cyber fraud in India. What are the risks involved? Examine the institutional response to cyber fraud in India, including the role of I4C, RBI, telecom regulators, and the judiciary. What more needs to be done?

The T20I series is expected to act as the final preparation for the World Cup in the shortest format that starts next month and Santner is banking on Mitchell to continue his run-scoring ways after getting two hundreds and an 80-odd in the three recent ODIs. Mitchell’s 352 runs were key to an under-strength New Zealand side registering a 1-2 series victory, their first on these shores. Much of that was on the back of his improved ability against spin, which Santner wants him to replicate during the upcoming series and T20 World Cup, to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka. “I have played with Daryl for a long time. The first time he came over (to India), he struggled with spin, but he has worked incredibly hard on his game. Now we can see the fruits of his labour,” Santner told the media on the eve of the first T20I. “He has really taken on the responsibility in the ODIs, especially since Kane (Williamson) is not there. We hope he does the same in the T20s.” Recent successes in India – before the ODI series, they inflicted the first-ever Test whitewash on the hosts in late 2024 – will give New Zealand confidence, Santner said. Also, several players in the squad are regulars in the Indian Premier League. There’s plenty of familiarity with the conditions they are expected to encounter. “Apart from a couple of debutants, everybody in this team who has been here before, in any format, knows what to expect. The teams that understand conditions and the wickets always have the best chance to do well (while touring),” Santner said. “The amount of times we have been able to come and play in India has been good, and there have been some good recent results because of that. It was great what we did in the one-dayers, but this is a different format and (against) a different team as well.” Stay updated with the latest sports news across Cricket, Football, Chess, and more.

Out of the 30 pitches, 18 founders have bagged a deal, while 12 have not succeeded. Amongst the 12 to lose out on investment is Wrestlefanent founder Nikunj Walia from Delhi. 32-year-old Nikunj has been a crazy wrestling fan all his life, and he converted his passion into a business. However, his idea didn’t seem to appeal to the Sharks, while Aman Gupta declared him mad right as he entered the tank, Vineeta Singh also highlighted a huge gap in the founder accepting the reality of his business. Kunal Bahl also reminisced about his fondness towards WWE; however, all the Sharks declared the business as ‘not investible’. Founded by Delhi’s Nikunj Walia, Wrestlefanent is a fan engagement platform that helps wrestling lovers to become an active and engaged community. They conduct fan festivals, gaming leagues, celebrity meets, and more. They also make B2B content. Bringing this passionate business onto the tank, Nikunj demanded an investment of Rs 75 lakhs for 10 percent equity, placing the company’s valuation at Rs 7.5 crores. Talking about his journey, the founder also shared that he had been applying to the show for four years and kept getting rejected. Also Read: Namita Thapar calls Shark Tank India 5 pitcher ‘magical’ after he demonstrates device that can help Cerebral Palsy patients     A post shared by Shark Tank India (@sharktank.india)  Nikunj entered the tank like wrestlers do, as he walked to his spot, he announced himself as a ‘legend who turned rejection into hustle.’ Seeing his over-the-top entry into the Tank, Aman Gupta called him a “Pagal aadmi (mad man).” When the founder revealed he was from Delhi, Kunal Bahl said, “Nahi bhi batate toh pata chalta (We would have figured even if you didn’t tell us).” During his pitch, Nikunj revealed that he had been applying to be on the show since 2021; however, the idea and concept kept getting rejected. Further in his pitch, Nikunj asked Aman if he wanted to try the wrestler’s belt. Aman jokingly asked, “Aise toh hai nahi ki tu belt bech raha hai. (I hope you are not selling belts).” Further in the pitch, the founder revealed that they made a revenue of Rs 13 lakhs in 2024-25, with a profit of Rs 6.3 lakhs last year. However, 90 percent of the revenue came from the B2B content they made. He also pointed out that live events since 2022 have seen growth, but also made losses for him. When Kunal asked the founder about the size of the fan community, an unsure Nikunj ended up talking about the market size; he even fumbled when Namita asked him for some statistics on others who conduct live events. Later, Aman Gupta questioned the founder, “You are 32, at this age, if you were working, your salary would have been more than this, so sometimes do you feel that what you are doing is wrong?” Nikunj responds, “Everyone feels dejected. I also thought I might not be able to do it. But I am happy making less money, rather than sitting in someone’s office.” Namita also backed Aman’s point and said, “It’s not about not following your passion, but when you decide to do so, then there should also be a seriousness about depth.” Unfortunately, Nikunj did not bag a deal in his fifth attempt on the show. Giving their verdict, the Sharks wished Nikunj well and advised him to focus more on live events rather than content production. Sharing his views, Aman Gupta said, “I always recommend people to stay happy. It’s important to convert this passion into a business, but you need to do something to make this investible. As of now, it lacks this, so unfortunately, I am out.” Namita Thapar also opts out and says, “Nikunj, you have childlike zest which is contagious, never lose that, but you also need balance. As of now, there is no visibility in terms of which direction this is headed. We will see you in the future again, but for today, I am out.” Kunal went on to revisit his childhood and shared that he has been a die-hard fan of wrestling. “My elder brother and my entire childhood have been about giving chokeslams on the bed to one another. Amazing memories came back.” He later appreciated the live events bit and said, “I think this is yet to become a business, your passion and energy are amazing though.” Kunal also opted out.     A post shared by Shark Tank India (@sharktank.india)  Sharing her views, Vineeta Singh said, “Numbers don’t lie, and if you draw a salary, the profits you have shown won’t remain. There is a huge gap between your reality and imagination. It’s important not to make Khayali pulao and do something where people want to give money. It’s not at all invisible today.” Ritesh Agarwal also added, “What lacks the most is your inability to say no to your content business. You need to let that go; until you focus completely on live events, you will be called an outsourced content shop. Once you make live events bigger, I would love to meet you again, we are of the same age, so I hope to do something exciting ahead.” So far on Shark Tank India 5, Kunal Bahl has committed the maximum investments worth Rs 10.31 crores, followed by Anupam Mittal, Namita Thapar, and Aman Gupta.

    "summary": "A year into Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, the US president has spearheaded a trade war against the world in the name of American exceptionalism.

    "full_text": "A year into Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, the US president has spearheaded a trade war against the world in the name of American exceptionalism. However, the brunt is being borne almost entirely by the American consumer, according to a new study by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. According to the report, titled “America’s Own Goal: Who Pays the Tariffs?” nearly the entire cost has fallen on American consumers and importers. “The claim that foreign countries pay these tariffs is a myth,” said Julian Hinz, Research Director at the institute and an author of the study. “The data show the opposite: Americans are footing the bill.” On April 2, 2025, Trump announced that all US trading partners would face a “baseline” 10% tariff, and country-specific “reciprocal tariffs.” Currently, Brazil and India face the highest US tariffs, 50% each, on their exports to the US. Over the past week, the US President has reignited this trade war, announcing 10% tariffs against Greenland and members of the European Union for rejecting his territorial claims over the Danish territory, effective February 1, which would be increased to 25% on June 1. Trump also threatened 200% tariffs against France for preparing to reject an invitation to the proposed Board of Peace, a body mandated to oversee the peace process in Gaza. Here are the main takeaways from the report: The tariff burden is virtually a consumption tax on American buyers. Trump’s escalating tariff announcements have rested on a singular premise: that tariffs can be deployed to extract concessions from trading partners, and “return” money to the US, at no cost to American households. However, the tariff burden has effectively translated into a distorted consumption tax on Americans, which selectively targets imported goods. American importers and the final consumer bear 96%, while the rest is by foreign exporters, according to the study. Using high-frequency, shipment-level data covering over 25 million transactions and nearly $4 trillion in trade value, the study found that US customs revenue increased by about $200 billion in 2025. However, foreign exporters did not reduce their prices in response to tariffs, transferring nearly the entire tariff burden to American importers, and thus the US consumer. This means the additional customs revenue came almost entirely from the wallets of domestic consumers. “Every dollar of tariff revenue represents a dollar extracted from American businesses and households,” the study says. Exporters did not lower prices, only reduced trade volumes in response to tariffs. Tariffs are conventionally used to restrict imports by increasing their prices, presumably to make domestic alternatives competitive, or to otherwise add to government revenue. However, in the face of Trump’s escalating tariff announcements in his second term, exporters worldwide chose not to absorb the tariff into their prices, but lowered their export volumes instead. The result? Fewer, similar goods. American firms using foreign-sourced inputs are among the worst affected, with immediate disruptions to their supply chains from reduced volume and increased costs. They must choose to absorb these costs and reduce profits and investment, pass them to customers and thus increase the final price, or find alternative sources and incur adjustment costs and delays. This finding is especially true of Brazil and India, the two most-tariffed nations currently. The US slapped 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil on August 6, 2025, and a 25% tariff on imports from India later that month, doubling it days later on August 27. Exporters from both nations did not lower their prices to offset the additional tariff burden, but did not “eat” the tariff, and reduced their export volumes sharply. The report compared Indian exports to the US against Indian exports to the EU, Canada, and Australia, all regions that did not announce new tariffs on Indian goods during this period. It found that exports to the US remained unchanged compared to other destinations. However, Indian exports to the US fell by approximately 18-24% relative to other destinations, and quantities by similar magnitudes. “We compared Indian exports to the US with shipments to Europe and Canada and identified a clear pattern,” Hinz said in a policy brief accompanying the report. “Both export value and volume to the US dropped sharply, by up to 24%. But unit prices—the prices Indian exporters charged—remained unchanged. They shipped less, not cheaper.” Presence of alternative markets, sticky supply chains may be responsible for unchanged prices. Exporters facing US tariffs could choose to reroute their product to markets in Europe, Asia or other destinations, and thus not have to reduce their prices. Similarly, the unpredictability of the tariff announcements could have given exporters less of an impetus to adjust their prices in response. The practicality of making such changes is also a factor: For countries like Brazil and India which face a 50% tariff, exporters would need to cut their prices by a third, a massive cut to their margins which would be unacceptable for most firms. The unviability for American importers to find alternative sources – fast – also grants suppliers pricing power. Thus foreign exporters face less pressure to cut prices. The results mirror a similar situation in 2018-19, the last time Trump launched a trade war with China. Studies that analysed the impact of Trump’s trade war with China in 2018-19, saw a similar outcome. US consumers almost entirely bore the brunt of Trump’s tariffs on imports from China. Chinese exporters did not reduce their dollar prices to maintain market share, but reduced their trade volumes. The present study referred to this period and identified three key reasons for this outcome then: the lack of close substitutes for the tariffed goods, the capacity constraints on Chinese exporters that meant they could not export elsewhere, and the stickiness of supply chains, making it difficult for US importers to immediately find new suppliers.    The drama surrounding the Beckhams has reached new heights as Brooklyn Beckham cuts ties with his parents and enjoys life with his wife and her billionaire parents.

From Assam’s communal flare-up and the BJP’s leadership change to the UK’s nod for a new Chinese Embassy and Trump’s criticism of Britain’s Chagos deal, Tuesday saw major developments. Sports action intensified with WPL and Alcaraz’s serve tweak, while business, education, and air quality concerns shaped India’s regulatory and academic landscape. Quote of the day  A person who wants to function creatively has to function at risk… The trick, of course, is to lose one day and come back to win the next The quote is by John Fitch, an American inventor and trailblazer, who is remembered for launching the first successful steamboat service in the United States. A communal flare-up following a car accident in Assam’s Kokrajhar spiralled into violence on Tuesday, leading to the deployment of Rapid Action Force and prompting the state government to snap mobile internet services in the district. With Nitin Nabin taking charge as the BJP’s national president on Tuesday, the ruling party has formally closed the chapter on J P Nadda’s extended tenure and brought itself back in line with its long-standing “one person, one post” principle. Authorities in the United Kingdom on Tuesday approved the construction of a new Chinese Embassy building in London, which had been stalled due to potential security concerns. The proposed embassy building in central London will come up on the land that was once home to the Royal Mint Court, where Britain used to mint its coins. Bangladesh is among 38 countries in the world whose citizens will have to pay a visa bond of US$ 5,000-15,000 for a B1/B2 (business and tourist) visa for the United States. US President Donald Trump called out the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer-led government for a deal, wherein Britain would cede sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, which includes an island with a strategic US-UK air base, to Mauritius as an act of “great stupidity” and “total weakness”. With the race for the 2026 Women’s Premier League playoffs heating up, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led Mumbai Indians will take on the Jemimah Rodrigues-led Delhi Capitals in Match No. 13 of the WPL at the BCA Stadium in Kotambi. The highlight of the 2026 Australian Open opening round was Carlos Alcaraz’s subtle serve change, showing both his ongoing effort to refine the stroke and hints of whom he is emulating.” Even as IndiGo continues to be under the regulatory scanner following the massive network-wide disruption in December, the airline expects to maintain its curtailed flight schedule beyond February 10, when the specific pilot duty and rest duration rules-related exemptions granted to it are set to expire. In April, over 8 crore contributing members of the retirement fund body Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) will be able to withdraw their funds using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) via the BHIM app. In response to the deteriorating air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR), the Office of the District Inspector of Schools (DIOS), Gautam Budh Nagar, has mandated a shift to hybrid learning for schools across Delhi and neighbouring districts. The new directives, falling under Stages 3 and 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), aim to minimise children’s exposure to toxic smog while ensuring educational continuity. Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Department has released the admission schedule for the academic year 2026–27 through 25 per cent reservation in private schools as per the RTE Act-2009, as per a statement issued here on Monday.    The drama surrounding the Beckhams has reached new heights as Brooklyn Beckham cuts ties with his parents and enjoys life with his wife and her billionaire parents. His father-in-law, Nelson Peltz, has a rags-to-riches story, building a billion-dollar empire through various food companies. Meanwhile, David and Victoria Beckham have also amassed a fortune through their individual careers.",

Justice Pavan Kumar Dwivedi was hearing a plea seeking rehearing of the second appeal to recall an ex parte judgment passed in April 2025 in a long-pending family dispute relating to the declaration of title and partition of property, where the applicants claimed that their counsel did not inform them about the hearing. “It is clear that once a party to the litigation engaged a lawyer to represent him/them, then it was a bona fide belief on the part of the said litigant that the said counsel would duly represent him/them as and when the case is listed before the Court. It is not his duty to act as a watchdog of the advocate on each and every date,” the court said. The petitioners were also seeking the condonation of the delay of 86 days in filing the present application for rehearing of the appeal, pointing to the same reason of their lawyer’s absence.
